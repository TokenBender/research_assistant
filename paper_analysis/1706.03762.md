**2.1 Introduction:**

- **Summary:** This section introduces the limitations of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for sequence transduction tasks, particularly their sequential nature hindering parallelization. It highlights the growing importance of attention mechanisms and positions the Transformer as a model that relies entirely on attention, eliminating recurrence and convolutions.
- **Significant Citations:**
    - **Claim:** "Recurrent neural networks, long short-term memory [13] and gated recurrent [7] neural networks in particular, have been firmly established as state of the art approaches in sequence modeling and transduction problems such as language modeling and machine translation [35, 2, 5]."

**2.2 Background:**

- **Summary:** This section discusses previous attempts to reduce sequential computation in sequence models, including Extended Neural GPU [16], ByteNet [18], and ConvS2S [9]. It points out the limitations of these convolutional approaches in handling long-range dependencies and introduces self-attention as a more efficient alternative.
- **Significant Citations:**
    - **Claim:** "The goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU [16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building block, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions."

    - **Explanation:** These citations showcase prior research efforts to improve the efficiency of sequence models by using convolutional architectures. They provide the context for the Transformer's approach, which aims to further reduce sequential computation through self-attention.
    - **Claim:** "In these models, the number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows in the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes it more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [12]."

    - **Explanation:** This citation explains the inherent limitation of convolutional approaches in capturing long-range dependencies efficiently. It supports the paper's argument for using self-attention, which can relate any two positions in a sequence with a constant number of operations.
    - **Claim:** "Self-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions of a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been used successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization, textual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22]."
