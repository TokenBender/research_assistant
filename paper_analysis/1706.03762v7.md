**2.2 Background:**

- **Summary:** This section discusses prior attempts to reduce sequential computation in sequence models, like Extended Neural GPU [16], ByteNet [18], and ConvS2S [9], which utilize convolutional neural networks (CNNs). It points out the limitations of CNNs in capturing long-range dependencies efficiently and introduces self-attention as a solution.
- **Significant Citations:**
    - **Claim:** "The goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU [16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building block, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions."

    - **Explanation:** These citations showcase prior research efforts focused on reducing sequential computation in sequence models by employing CNNs as the fundamental building block.
    - **Claim:** "In these models, the number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows in the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes it more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [12]."

    - **Explanation:** This citation highlights the inherent limitation of CNN-based approaches in efficiently capturing long-range dependencies due to the increasing computational cost with distance.
    - **Claim:** "Self-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions of a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been used successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization, textual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22]."
