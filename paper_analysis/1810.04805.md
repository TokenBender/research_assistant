    - **Relevance:** These citations provide a historical overview of word representation learning, highlighting the evolution from non-neural to neural methods.
    - **Claim:** ELMo and its predecessor generalize traditional word embedding research along a different dimension. They extract context-sensitive features from a left-to-right and a right-to-left language model.
    - **Citation:** (Peters et al., 2017, 2018a)
    - **Relevance:** This citation introduces ELMo, a prominent contextual word embedding model that serves as a direct comparison point for BERT, highlighting BERT's advantages in capturing bidirectionality.
    - **Claim:** OpenAI GPT achieved previously state-of-the-art results on many sentence-level tasks from the GLUE benchmark.
    - **Citation:** (Radford et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2018a)
    - **Relevance:** This citation introduces OpenAI GPT, a strong baseline model that utilizes a unidirectional language model for pre-training. BERT aims to surpass GPT by leveraging bidirectionality.

**2.3 BERT:**

- **Summary:** This section introduces BERT's architecture, input/output representations, and the two novel pre-training tasks: Masked Language Model (MLM) and Next Sentence Prediction (NSP). It also describes the fine-tuning procedure for adapting BERT to various downstream tasks.
- **Significant Citations:**
    - **Claim:** BERT's model architecture is a multi-layer bidirectional Transformer encoder based on the original implementation described in Vaswani et al. (2017).
    - **Citation:** (Vaswani et al., 2017)
    - **Relevance:** This citation introduces the Transformer architecture, the foundation of BERT's model design, highlighting its importance in enabling efficient and powerful language modeling.
    - **Claim:** The masked language model randomly masks some of the tokens from the input, and the objective is to predict the original vocabulary id of the masked word based only on its context.
    - **Citation:** (Taylor, 1953)
    - **Relevance:** This citation introduces the Cloze task, which inspired the MLM pre-training objective, providing historical context and justification for BERT's approach to capturing bidirectionality.
