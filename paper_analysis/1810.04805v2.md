- **Significant Citations:**
    - **Claim:** "The masked language model randomly masks some of the tokens from the input, and the objective is to predict the original vocabulary id of the masked word based only on its context."
    - **Citation:** (Taylor, 1953)
    - **Relevance:** Introduces the concept of the Cloze task, which inspired the MLM pre-training objective.
    - **Claim:** "Many important downstream tasks such as Question Answering (QA) and Natural Language Inference (NLI) are based on understanding the relationship between two sentences, which is not directly captured by language modeling."
    - **Citation:** (Rajpurkar et al., 2016; Bowman et al., 2015)
    - **Relevance:** Explains the motivation for the NSP task by highlighting the importance of inter-sentence relationships in various NLP tasks.
