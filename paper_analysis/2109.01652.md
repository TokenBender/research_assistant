**3. Key Insights and Supporting Literature**

* **Instruction tuning significantly improves zero-shot performance:** The authors demonstrate that FLAN, the instruction-tuned model, consistently outperforms the base LaMDA-PT model and surpasses zero-shot GPT-3 on a majority of the evaluated datasets. This key insight is supported by comparisons with results reported in **Brown et al. (2020)** and **Du et al. (2021)**.

* **The benefits of instruction tuning are more pronounced with larger models:** The ablation study on model scale reveals that instruction tuning is particularly effective for larger models, potentially because they have sufficient capacity to learn both the instruction-following ability and the specific tasks. This finding is contextualized by the scaling laws observed in **Brown et al. (2020)**.

* **Instruction tuning is crucial for zero-shot performance on unseen tasks:** The ablation study on the role of instructions demonstrates that models finetuned without instructions perform significantly worse than FLAN, highlighting the importance of training with natural language instructions for zero-shot generalization. This finding is supported by comparisons with models finetuned without templates or with dataset names as prompts.

* **Instruction tuning facilitates prompt tuning:** The authors show that FLAN, the instruction-tuned model, responds better to continuous inputs from prompt tuning compared to the base LaMDA-PT model. This finding suggests that instruction tuning can result in a checkpoint that is more amenable to prompt tuning, a technique that leverages soft prompts for task adaptation. This analysis is based on the prompt tuning method introduced in **Li & Liang (2021)**.

**4. Experimental Methodology and Its Foundations**

* **Experimental Setup:** The authors use a rigorous evaluation methodology to assess zero-shot performance on unseen tasks. They group datasets into task clusters and ensure that no datasets from the same task cluster are seen during both instruction tuning and evaluation. This approach minimizes the risk of data contamination and provides a more robust measure of zero-shot generalization.

* **Cited Works as Basis for Methodology:** The authors draw on the concept of "examples-proportional mixing" from **Raffel et al. (2020)** to balance the different sizes of datasets during instruction tuning. They also adapt the rank classification approach used in **Brown et al. (2020)** for GPT-3, introducing the "options suffix" technique to improve performance on classification tasks.

* **Novel Aspects of Methodology:** The authors introduce their own novel definition of "unseen tasks" for evaluation, based on the concept of task clusters. This approach is more conservative than simply disallowing the same dataset to appear in training and evaluation, providing a stronger test of zero-shot generalization.

**5. Results in Context**

* **Main Results:** FLAN demonstrates significant improvements over the base LaMDA-PT model and surpasses zero-shot GPT-3 on 20 of 25 datasets. It exhibits particularly strong performance on tasks naturally verbalized as instructions, such as NLI, QA, and translation.

* **Comparison with Existing Literature:** The authors extensively compare their findings with results reported in **Brown et al. (2020)** and **Du et al. (2021)**, demonstrating FLAN's superior zero-shot performance compared to GPT-3 and GLaM on a majority of the evaluated datasets.

* **Confirmation, Contradiction, or Extension of Cited Works:** FLAN's strong performance on NLI tasks confirms the observation in **Brown et al. (2020)** that NLI examples are often awkwardly phrased as a continuation of a sentence in traditional language modeling settings. By phrasing NLI as a more natural question, FLAN achieves significantly better results.

**6. Discussion and Related Work**
