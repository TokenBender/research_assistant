- **Key Points:**
    - The discovered model, Primer, shows significant improvement over Transformer on the search task.
    - Primer-EZ, a simplified version with squared ReLUs and depthwise convolution in attention, is proposed for practical adoption.
- **Significant Citations:**
    - No specific citations are used in this section to support the claims about Primer's performance. The results are presented in later sections.

**3. Key Insights and Supporting Literature:**

- **Key Insight 1:** Primer achieves a target quality using a smaller training cost, a smaller inference cost, and higher quality given a fixed training cost.
    - **Supporting Citations:** These claims are supported by experimental results presented in Section 4, with comparisons to various Transformer baselines across different codebases, datasets, and hardware platforms.
- **Key Insight 2:** Primer's compute savings over Transformers increase as training cost grows, following a power law with respect to quality at optimal model sizes.

- **Key Insight 3:** Primer's improvements can be attributed to squaring ReLU activations and adding depthwise convolution after each Q, K, and V projection in self-attention.
    - **Supporting Citations:** Ablation and insertion studies in Appendix A.7 (Figure 26) demonstrate the individual effectiveness of these modifications. The authors also cite related work on rectified polynomials ([36]), GLU variants ([38, 39]), and depthwise convolutions in Transformers ([41, 42]).
