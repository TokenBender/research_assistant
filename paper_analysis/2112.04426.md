**2. Section-by-Section Analysis with Citation Extraction:**

**2.1 Introduction:**

- **Key Points:**
    - Language modeling (LM) is traditionally approached by scaling data, compute, and model parameters, leading to large models like GPT-3 (**Brown et al., 2020**) and Jurassic-1 (**Lieber et al., 2021**).
    - This work proposes a semi-parametric approach using retrieval from a large database to augment language models without significantly increasing computational cost.
    - Existing retrieval-based language models (**Guu et al., 2020; Khandelwal et al., 2020; Lewis et al., 2020; Yogatama et al., 2021**) are limited in transformer size and database scale.
