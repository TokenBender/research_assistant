You've provided a page from the paper "GLaM: Efficient Scaling of Language Models with Mixture-of-Experts" by Du et al. (2022). I'm ready to analyze this paper according to your guidelines, focusing on the citations and their role in supporting the authors' claims. 

However, analyzing a single page from a research paper won't provide the full context needed for a comprehensive analysis. I need the complete paper to accurately identify:

* **All citations:** A single page only shows a fraction of the references.
* **The full context of claims:**  Claims made on this page might be elaborated on or nuanced in other sections.
* **Methodology and results:**  Crucial for understanding the paper's contribution and how citations support the findings.

**Please provide the full paper so I can deliver a thorough and accurate analysis.** 

Once I have the complete paper, I will be able to:

1. **Summarize the paper's objectives and key findings.**
2. **Analyze each section, extracting significant citations and explaining their relevance.**
3. **Identify key insights and the literature supporting them.**
4. **Describe the experimental methodology and its foundations in cited works.**
5. **Contextualize the results within existing research using cited papers.**
6. **Examine how the authors position their work within the field.**
7. **Explore future work suggestions and their supporting citations.**
8. **Critically evaluate the effectiveness and potential biases in citation usage.**
9. **Provide a final summary of the paper's contribution and its use of cited literature.**

I'm eager to delve into the full paper and provide you with a detailed analysis that highlights the interplay between this research and the broader field of deep learning and LLMs.
