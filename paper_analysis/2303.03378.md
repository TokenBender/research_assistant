**2. Section-by-Section Analysis with Citation Extraction:**

**2.1 Introduction:**

- **Key Points:** LLMs exhibit strong reasoning capabilities but lack grounding in the real world. Connecting LLMs to visual and physical sensor modalities is crucial for solving real-world problems in robotics and computer vision. Existing approaches for interfacing LLMs with robotics have limitations.
- **Significant Citations:**
    - **Claim:** LLMs demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities across various domains, including dialogue, step-by-step reasoning, math problem solving, and code writing.
    - **Citation:** (Glaese et al., 2022; Thoppilan et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2022; Kojima et al., 2022; Lewkowycz et al., 2022; Polu et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2021a)
    - **Relevance:** These citations provide evidence for the broad reasoning capabilities of LLMs across diverse tasks, establishing the potential of LLMs as a foundation for embodied AI.
    - **Claim:** Connecting LLMs to real-world visual and physical sensor modalities is essential to solving a wider range of grounded real-world problems in computer vision and robotics.
    - **Citation:** (Tellex et al., 2020)
    - **Relevance:** This citation highlights the importance of grounding for LLMs to be effectively applied in robotics and computer vision, emphasizing the need for models like PaLM-E.
    - **Claim:** Previous work interfaces the output of LLMs with learned robotic policies and affordance functions to make decisions, but is limited in that the LLM itself is only provided with textual input.
    - **Citation:** (Ahn et al., 2022)
    - **Relevance:** This citation discusses a prior approach for integrating LLMs into robotics, which serves as a point of comparison for PaLM-E's direct integration of sensor data into the LLM.

**2.2 Related Work:**

- **Key Points:** This section discusses related work in general vision-language modeling, actions-output models, and the use of LLMs in embodied task planning.
- **Significant Citations:**
    - **Claim:** Recent years have seen a growing interest in large vision-language models (VLMs).
    - **Citation:** (Li et al., 2019; Lu et al., 2019; Hao et al., 2022; Gan et al., 2022)
    - **Relevance:** These citations provide a context for the increasing interest in VLMs, highlighting the trend towards models that can understand both images and text.
    - **Claim:** Prior works focus on combining vision and language inputs in an embodied setting with the goal of direct action prediction.
    - **Citation:** (Guhur et al., 2022; Shridhar et al., 2022b;a; Zhang & Chai, 2021; Silva et al., 2021; Jang et al., 2022; Nair et al., 2022; Lynch et al., 2022; Brohan et al., 2022)
    - **Relevance:** These citations discuss existing approaches for embodied AI that focus on direct action prediction, contrasting with PaLM-E's approach of generating high-level instructions.
    - **Claim:** One line of research has employed prompting to elicit a sequence of instructions directly from an LLM.
    - **Citation:** (Huang et al., 2022b; Ahn et al., 2022; Huang et al., 2022c; Nottingham et al., 2023; Zellers et al., 2021a; Shah et al., 2022; Huang et al., 2022a; Wang et al., 2023; Liang et al., 2022; Singh et al., 2022; Zeng et al., 2022)
    - **Relevance:** These citations discuss various methods for using prompting to extract instructions from LLMs for embodied tasks, providing a context for PaLM-E's approach of training the LLM to directly generate plans.
