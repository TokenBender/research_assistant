**2. Section-by-Section Analysis with Citation Extraction:**

**2.1 Introduction:**

- **Summary:** The introduction highlights the limitations of current LLMs, which rely on token-level, left-to-right decision-making, and proposes drawing inspiration from human cognition's dual-process model (System 1 and System 2) and classical AI planning to address these limitations.
- **Significant Citations:**
    - **Claim:** Research on "dual process" models suggests that people have two modes of decision-making: a fast, automatic mode ("System 1") and a slow, deliberate mode ("System 2").
    - **Citation:** Kahneman, D. (2011). Thinking, fast and slow. Macmillan.
    - **Relevance:** This citation establishes the cognitive basis for the ToT framework, which aims to augment the "System 1"-like behavior of LLMs with a more deliberate "System 2" planning process.
    - **Claim:** Newell and colleagues characterized problem solving as search through a combinatorial problem space, represented as a tree.

    - **Relevance:** This citation introduces the concept of problem-solving as tree search, which forms the foundation of the ToT framework.

**2.2 Background:**

- **Summary:** This section provides a brief overview of existing methods for problem-solving with LLMs, including input-output prompting, chain-of-thought prompting (CoT), and self-consistency with CoT (CoT-SC).
