    - On smaller corpora (NQ100k, TriviaQA), the paper achieves state-of-the-art results using a combination of techniques, including synthetic queries and in-domain query generation.
    - On the full MS MARCO dataset, simply scaling a model trained solely on synthetic queries to Naive ID generation demonstrates the best effectiveness among all techniques considered.
