**2. Section-by-Section Analysis with Citation Extraction:**

**2.1 Introduction:**

- **Summary:** The introduction highlights the limitations of in-context learning and fine-tuning for LLMs, particularly the dependence on prompt engineering and the computational cost. It introduces LMCOR as a solution that leverages training data without requiring access to LLM weights, by correcting LLM outputs based on a pool of generated candidates.

    - **Claim:** Large language models have demonstrated near state-of-the-art performance on various tasks via in-context learning.
    - **Citation:** Brown et al., 2020b,a; Chowdhery et al., 2022
    - **Relevance:** Establishes the context of LLMs and their capabilities through in-context learning, a key concept the paper aims to improve upon.
    - **Claim:** The effectiveness of in-context learning can vary significantly depending on the task instruction, the quantity, relevance, and even the order of the in-context examples.

    - **Relevance:** Highlights the limitations and inconsistencies of in-context learning, motivating the need for more robust methods like LMCOR.
    - **Claim:** Fine-tuning, on the other hand, has been proven highly effective when task-specific datasets are available, with smaller, fine-tuned models outperforming few-shot-prompted LLMs on various tasks.
    - **Citation:** Lester et al., 2021; Chowdhery et al., 2022; Xu et al., 2023
    - **Relevance:** Acknowledges the effectiveness of fine-tuning but also points out its limitations, particularly the computational cost and potential impact on few-shot performance, further justifying the need for LMCOR.

**2.2 Correcting the Outputs of LLMs:**

- **Summary:** This section details the LMCOR approach, explaining how it leverages the diversity of LLM-generated candidates to produce a superior output. It describes the headroom analysis conducted to demonstrate the potential of combining candidate spans and outlines the process of generating and correcting candidates.
- **Significant Citations:**
    - **Claim:** LLMs can generate a diverse array of candidates for a single input which are often complimentary.
    - **Citation:** Figure 2 (paper's own figure)
    - **Relevance:** This claim is supported by the paper's own headroom analysis, visualized in Figure 2, which shows the potential of combining candidate spans to improve performance.
    - **Claim:** Fine-tuned 11B-parameter state-of-the-art (sota) GEC model.
    - **Citation:** Rothe et al., 2021
    - **Relevance:** Establishes the baseline performance for the Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) task, against which LMCOR's performance is compared.
    - **Claim:** By sampling 10 times from the LLM and employing an oracle to rank the samples (oracle-rank) or to combine correct spans (oracle-combine), we obtain significant improvements, surpassing state-of-the-art.
    - **Citation:** Figure 2 (paper's own figure)
    - **Relevance:** Demonstrates the potential of leveraging multiple generations through ranking or combining, motivating the development of LMCOR to learn this process automatically.

**2.3 Experiments & Results:**
