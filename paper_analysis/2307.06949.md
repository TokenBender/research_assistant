**2.1 Introduction**

**Key Points:**

- T2I personalization allows generating images of specific individuals in diverse styles, leveraging the strong prior of pre-trained diffusion models.

- The paper aims to address these limitations while preserving the key advantages of DreamBooth, namely style diversity and subject fidelity.

**Significant Citations:**

- **Claim:** DreamBooth [25] allows for the generation of new images of a specific face or person in different styles, preserving the subject's essence even when applying vastly different styles.
