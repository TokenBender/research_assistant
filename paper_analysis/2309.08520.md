**3. Key Insights and Supporting Literature:**

- **Insight 1:** Sparsity affects each model size similarly, primarily as a multiplicative constant to the size scaling, and does not significantly interact with data scaling.
    - **Supporting Citations:** Kaplan et al., 2020; Hoffmann et al., 2022.
    - **Contribution:** This suggests that the benefits of sparsity are largely independent of the amount of training data, which is a key difference from previous observations on smaller datasets.
- **Insight 2:** Optimal sparsity (Sopt) for a given inference size and training budget can be derived analytically from the scaling law, allowing for prediction of regimes where sparsity offers benefits over dense model rescaling and extended training.
    - **Supporting Citations:** Hoffmann et al., 2022.
    - **Contribution:** This provides a practical tool for determining when sparsity is a viable option for improving efficiency.
- **Insight 3:** Sopt iso-contours run parallel to the dense compute optimal Chinchilla line, indicating that optimal sparsity increases with longer training.
    - **Supporting Citations:** Hoffmann et al., 2022.
    - **Contribution:** This suggests that sparsity becomes increasingly beneficial as training budgets increase, potentially offering significant gains beyond the limits of dense model scaling.
- **Insight 4:** The main conclusions of the scaling law hold for hardware-friendly n:m sparsity patterns (**Mishra et al., 2021**) and pruning well-trained dense models is more efficient than training from scratch (if dense checkpoints exist).
    - **Supporting Citations:** Mishra et al., 2021.
    - **Contribution:** This extends the applicability of the findings to practical scenarios where hardware acceleration for structured sparsity is available.

**4. Experimental Methodology and Its Foundations:**

- **Experimental Setup:** The paper uses a grid search approach, varying model size, training data/steps, and sparsity levels for both ViT/JFT-4B and T5/C4. Sparsification is performed during training using gradual magnitude pruning.
- **Cited Works as Basis for Methodology:** The authors follow the original training recipes for ViT (**Zhai et al., 2022**) and T5 (**Raffel et al., 2020b**), adapting AdaFactor (**Shazeer & Stern, 2018**) for sparsity-awareness.
- **Novel Aspects:** The paper introduces a novel scaling law incorporating sparsity, model size, and training data. The authors justify this approach based on empirical observations and the need for a unified framework to understand the interplay of these factors.

**5. Results in Context:**

- **Main Results:** The paper presents a novel scaling law (Equation 1) that accurately predicts the validation loss of sparse Transformers across various model sizes, training data amounts, and sparsity levels. The law reveals that sparsity primarily affects model size scaling and that optimal sparsity increases with longer training.
- **Comparison with Existing Literature:** The authors compare their findings with the Chinchilla optimal compute line (**Hoffmann et al., 2022**) and show that optimal sparsity contours run parallel to it. They also analyze the limit performance of sparse models compared to dense models, finding that sparsity can offer significant capacity gains (Table 2).
- **Confirmation, Contradiction, or Extension:** The results confirm the general power-law scaling behavior observed in previous work (**Kaplan et al., 2020**) but extend it to incorporate sparsity. The findings also suggest that sparsity can offer benefits beyond the limits of dense model scaling, particularly with longer training budgets.
