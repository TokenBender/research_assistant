**2. Section-by-Section Analysis with Citation Extraction:**

**2.1 Introduction:**

- **Key Points:**
    - Hand-crafted prompt strategies, while effective, are often sub-optimal.
    - The paper proposes PROMPTBREEDER, a self-referential self-improvement mechanism for evolving prompts.
    - This approach draws inspiration from the idea of neural networks modifying their own "program" (weight matrix) as suggested by **Schmidhuber (1990)**.
    - The paper argues that prompts can be seen as the "program" of an LLM, and thus LLMs can be used to modify their own prompts, leading to self-improvement.
- **Significant Citations:**
    - **Schmidhuber, J. (1990). Making the world differentiable: On using fully recurrent self-supervised neural networks for dynamic reinforcement learning and planning in non-stationary environments.** *This citation is relevant because it introduces the concept of neural networks modifying their own weight matrix, which serves as the foundation for the self-referential aspect of PROMPTBREEDER.*

**3. PROMPTBREEDER:**

- **Key Points:**
    - PROMPTBREEDER is a prompt evolution system that uses LLMs to generate variations of task-prompts and mutation-prompts.
    - It employs a binary tournament genetic algorithm to select and evolve prompts based on their fitness on a training set.
    - The system utilizes five classes of mutation operators:
        - Direct Mutation (zero-order and first-order prompt generation)
        - Estimation of Distribution Mutation (EDA, EDA Rank and Index, Lineage Based)
        - Hypermutation (zero-order and first-order hyper-mutation)
        - Lamarckian Mutation (Working Out to Task-Prompt)
        - Prompt Crossover and Context Shuffling

**4. Experimental Methodology and Its Foundations:**

- **Experimental Setup:**
    - Population size: 50 units
    - Evolution: 20-30 generations
    - Datasets: GSM8K, SVAMP, MultiArith, AddSub, AQUA-RAT, SingleEq, CSQA, StrategyQA, ETHOS (Hate Speech Classification), Instruction Induction
- **Cited Works as Basis for Methodology:**
    - The paper uses a binary tournament genetic algorithm (**Harvey, 2011**) as the evolutionary framework.
    - BERT embeddings (**Devlin et al., 2019**) are used for diversity maintenance in the Estimation of Distribution Mutation.
- **Novel Aspects of Methodology:**
    - The paper introduces the concept of self-referential hypermutation, where LLMs are used to evolve mutation-prompts, leading to self-improvement of the prompt evolution process itself.
    - This novel approach is not directly based on any specific cited work but builds upon the broader concept of evolvability in evolutionary computation (**Dawkins, 2003; Pigliucci, 2008; Payne & Wagner, 2019; Gajewski et al., 2019**).

**5. Results in Context:**

- **Main Results:**
    - PROMPTBREEDER outperforms state-of-the-art prompt strategies, including Plan-and-Solve (**Wang et al., 2023b**), on a range of reasoning benchmarks.
    - It achieves significant improvements in both zero-shot and few-shot settings.
    - The system is able to evolve complex domain-specific prompts for tasks like hate speech classification, demonstrating its adaptability.
