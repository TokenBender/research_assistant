**2. Section-by-Section Analysis with Citation Extraction:**

**Introduction:**

- **Claim:** Transformer-based language models generate tokens in immediate succession, limiting the number of operations per layer to the number of tokens seen.
- **Citation:** Vaswani et al. (2017). Attention is all you need. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 30.
- **Relevance:** This citation establishes the standard Transformer architecture and its inherent constraint on computational operations per layer.

**Related Work:**

- **Claim:** Appending dummy tokens during inference alone does not improve chain-of-thought reasoning.
- **Citation:** Lanham et al. (2023). Measuring faithfulness in chain-of-thought reasoning.
- **Relevance:** This work highlights the need for training with delays to utilize the new computational pathways offered by inference-time delays.
- **Claim:** Prepending dummy tokens during training and inference on target tasks yields minimal performance gains.
- **Citation:** Burtsev et al. (2020). Memory transformer. arXiv preprint arXiv:2006.11527.
- **Relevance:** This work motivates the authors to explore the impact of appending delays during all stages of training and inference.

**3. Key Insights and Supporting Literature:**

- **Insight:** Training models with pause tokens during both pretraining and finetuning (PausePT_PauseFT) leads to significant performance gains on various downstream tasks.

- **Contribution:** These citations provide the context for the datasets and pretraining methodology used to demonstrate the effectiveness of pause-training.

- **Insight:** Introducing delays only during finetuning (StdPT_PauseFT) yields mixed results, with gains on some benchmarks but performance degradation on others.
- **Contribution:** This finding emphasizes the importance of pause-pretraining for realizing the benefits of inference-time delays.

**4. Experimental Methodology and Its Foundations:**

- **Experimental Setup:** The authors use decoder-only Transformer models (1B and 130M parameters) pretrained on the C4 dataset and finetuned on nine downstream tasks.
- **Citation for Pretraining Dataset:** Raffel et al. (2020). Exploring the limits of transfer learning with a unified text-to-text transformer. J. Mach. Learn. Res.
- **Novel Aspect:** The introduction of learnable pause tokens during both pretraining and finetuning is a novel aspect of the methodology.
- **Justification for Novelty:** The authors do not cite specific works to justify this novel approach, but they motivate it by highlighting the limitations of existing approaches that use dummy tokens only during inference or finetuning.

**5. Results in Context:**

- **Main Result:** PausePT_PauseFT outperforms standard training (StdPT_StdFT) on eight tasks for the 1B model and six tasks for the 130M model.
- **Comparison with Existing Literature:** The authors compare their results with standard baselines on each downstream task, demonstrating significant improvements on tasks like SQuAD, CommonSenseQA, and GSM8k.
- **Confirmation of Cited Works:** The authors' findings confirm the observations of Lanham et al. (2023) that filler characters during inference alone do not provide gains.
