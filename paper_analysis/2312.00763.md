**2. Section-by-Section Analysis with Citation Extraction:**

**2.1 Introduction:**

- **Key Points:** The introduction highlights the limitations of current LLM chatbots, particularly their linear, text-heavy interaction patterns and the cognitive load they impose on users, especially for complex tasks. It emphasizes the need for new interaction patterns that leverage both natural language and graphical user interfaces to improve user experience.
- **Significant Citations:**
    - **Claim:** "Large language model (LLM) powered chatbots are primarily text-based today, and impose a large interactional cognitive load, especially for exploratory or sensemaking tasks such as planning a trip or learning about a new city."
    - **Citation:**  None (This is an observation based on the current state of chatbots).
    - **Relevance:** Sets the stage for the paper's motivation by highlighting the limitations of existing chatbot interfaces.
    - **Claim:** "Because the interaction is textual, users have little scaffolding in the way of structure, informational “scent", or ability to specify high-level preferences or goals."
    - **Citation:** None (This is another observation based on the current state of chatbots).
    - **Relevance:** Further emphasizes the limitations of text-based interfaces, particularly in providing structure and guidance for complex tasks.
    - **Claim:** "Just as non-AI-experts use ad-hoc repair strategies to improve prompts for LLMs [54], non-expert users similarly use ad-hoc tactics like adding details to their request, pointing out assistant errors in how the request was interpreted, or simply giving up on their original task and deviating to a related, simpler task [16]."
