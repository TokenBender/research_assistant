**2.1 Introduction:**

- **Key Points:**
    - RLHF, also known as preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL), is a technique for policy optimization based on relative feedback. 
    - Traditional RLHF relies on reward models, which can lead to issues with intransitive preferences and reduced generation diversity.
    - Reward-model-free approaches based on dueling often suffer from instability due to adversarial training.

**2.2 Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback via Game Solving:**

- **Key Points:**
    - The paper introduces the concept of a Minimax Winner (MW) from social choice theory as a solution concept for RLHF.
    - MWs are more robust to intransitive preferences than Copeland Winners (CWs), which are often used implicitly in reward-model-based approaches.
    - The paper proves that a symmetric MW always exists and can be computed by running a single no-regret algorithm against its own iterates.
