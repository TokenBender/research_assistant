## 4. Experimental Methodology and Its Foundations

**Experimental Setup:**

The paper evaluates the proposed model on the English-to-French translation task using the WMT'14 dataset. It compares the performance of the proposed model (RNNsearch) with a baseline RNN Encoder-Decoder model (RNNencdec). The models are trained using a minibatch stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm with Adadelta for adaptive learning rate. The models are evaluated using BLEU score on a held-out test set.

**Foundations in Cited Works:**

* **RNN Encoder-Decoder:** The paper builds upon the RNN Encoder-Decoder framework proposed by Cho et al. (2014a) and Sutskever et al. (2014).
* **Bidirectional RNNs:** The encoder uses a bidirectional RNN (BiRNN), a technique previously used in speech recognition (Schuster & Paliwal, 1997; Graves et al., 2013).
* **Gated Recurrent Units:** The RNNs use gated recurrent units, similar to LSTMs (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997), to address the vanishing gradient problem.
* **Maxout Networks:** The decoder uses a maxout layer (Goodfellow et al., 2013) for the output layer.
* **Adadelta:** The training uses the Adadelta algorithm (Zeiler, 2012) for adaptive learning rate.

**Novel Aspects of Methodology:**

The core novelty lies in the proposed architecture that jointly learns to align and translate. This is achieved by introducing a soft-attention mechanism in the decoder, allowing it to dynamically focus on relevant parts of the source sentence during translation. The authors cite Graves (2013) as inspiration for the attention mechanism, but adapt it to the specific context of NMT.


## 5. Results in Context

**Main Results:**

* The proposed RNNsearch model outperforms the baseline RNNencdec model in terms of BLEU score, especially for longer sentences.
* The RNNsearch model achieves performance comparable to the state-of-the-art phrase-based system (Moses) when considering only sentences without unknown words.
* The qualitative analysis of the alignment model reveals linguistically plausible alignments between source and target sentences.

**Comparison with Existing Literature:**

* **Confirmation:** The results confirm the hypothesis that fixed-length vector representations are a bottleneck for NMT, particularly for longer sentences (Cho et al., 2014b; Pouget-Abadie et al., 2014).
* **Extension:** The results extend the existing literature on NMT by demonstrating that jointly learning to align and translate can significantly improve performance, especially for longer sentences. This extends the work of Sutskever et al. (2014) and Cho et al. (2014a) by incorporating a soft-attention mechanism.
* **Comparison:** The paper compares the performance of the proposed model to the baseline RNNencdec model and to the state-of-the-art phrase-based system (Moses), highlighting the competitive performance of the proposed approach.
