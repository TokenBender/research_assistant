### 2.5 Attention

**Summary:** This section dives into the core mechanism of the Transformer: the attention function. It introduces the scaled dot-product attention and multi-head attention, explaining their workings and benefits.

**Significant Citations:**

* **Claim:** "The two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multiplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor of 1/√dk."
    * **Citation:** [2] Dzmitry Bahdanau, Kyunghyun Cho, and Yoshua Bengio. Neural machine translation by jointly learning to align and translate. CoRR, abs/1409.0473, 2014.
    * **Relevance:** This citation introduces the two main types of attention mechanisms, providing context for the scaled dot-product attention proposed in the paper.

* **Claim:** "While for small values of dk the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms dot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk [3]. We suspect that for large values of dk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has extremely small gradients."

    * **Relevance:** This citation explains the motivation for scaling the dot products in the scaled dot-product attention, addressing a potential issue with the standard dot-product attention.


### 2.6 Positional Encoding

**Summary:** This section addresses the challenge of incorporating positional information into the Transformer, which lacks recurrence and convolution. It explains the use of sinusoidal positional encodings to provide the model with information about the order of the input sequence.

**Significant Citations:**

* **Claim:** "Since our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the order of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the tokens in the sequence. To this end, we add "positional encodings" to the input embeddings at the bottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel as the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings, learned and fixed [9]."

    * **Relevance:** This citation acknowledges the prior work on positional encodings, particularly in the context of convolutional sequence-to-sequence models, and sets the stage for the authors' proposed solution.


### 2.7 Why Self-Attention

**Summary:** This section compares self-attention layers to recurrent and convolutional layers in terms of computational complexity, parallelizability, and the ability to learn long-range dependencies. It highlights the advantages of self-attention, particularly for longer sequences.

**Significant Citations:**

* **Claim:** "As noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially executed operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations. In terms of computational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence length n is smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with sentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece [38] and byte-pair [31] representations."

    * **Relevance:** This citation highlights the computational efficiency of self-attention compared to recurrent layers, particularly in the context of machine translation, where the sequence length can be substantial.

* **Claim:** "One key factor affecting the ability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to traverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input and output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]."
