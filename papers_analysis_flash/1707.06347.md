**2. Section-by-Section Analysis with Citation Extraction**

**2.1 Introduction**

- **Summary:** The introduction highlights the need for a reinforcement learning method that is scalable, data-efficient, and robust.

- **Significant Citations:** None directly related to the KL penalty approach in this section.


**2.5 Algorithm**
