## 4. Experimental Methodology and Its Foundations

**Experimental Setup:**

The authors evaluate talking-heads attention using two primary models:

1. **Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (T5):** This model is pre-trained on a denoising objective using the C4 dataset and then fine-tuned on various language understanding tasks.
2. **ALBERT:** This model is a variation of BERT that shares layer parameters and factorizes the word embedding, making it more efficient.

The experiments involve varying the number of attention heads, key/value dimensions, and the application of logits and weights projections. They measure performance using metrics like perplexity, SQUAD scores, and GLUE scores.

**Foundations in Cited Works:**

* **Transformer Model:** The authors leverage the Transformer architecture introduced by Vaswani et al. (2017) as the basis for their T5 experiments.
* **Multi-Head Attention:** The core concept of multi-head attention, as described in Vaswani et al. (2017), is the foundation for the proposed "talking-heads attention."
* **T5 Model and Dataset:** The T5 model and its associated transfer learning setup, including the C4 dataset, are based on the work of Raffel et al. (2019).
* **ALBERT Model:** The ALBERT model and its pre-training setup are based on the work of Lan et al. (2019).

**Novel Aspects of Methodology:**

The primary novel aspect is the introduction of "talking-heads attention," which involves inserting linear projections across the attention-heads dimension before and after the softmax operation. The authors do not explicitly cite any prior work that uses this specific approach, suggesting it as a novel contribution.


## 5. Results in Context

**Main Results:**

* Talking-heads attention consistently outperforms standard multi-head attention across various tasks and metrics in both the T5 and ALBERT models.
* The performance gains are particularly noticeable when the key and value dimensions are relatively small.
* Applying only the logits or weights projection separately does not yield significant improvements.
* Dynamic projections, while reducing perplexity during pre-training, do not lead to improvements in downstream tasks.

**Comparison with Existing Literature:**

* **T5:** The authors' results on T5 generally outperform the baseline results reported in Raffel et al. (2019), potentially due to the absence of dropout during pre-training.
* **ALBERT:** The authors' results on ALBERT show that talking-heads attention can further improve the performance of this model, extending the findings of Lan et al. (2019).
* **BERT:** The authors' experiments on BERT confirm the effectiveness of talking-heads attention in improving performance on tasks like SQUAD and MNLI, building upon the work of Devlin et al. (2018).
