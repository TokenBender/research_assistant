## 2. Section-by-Section Analysis with Citation Extraction

### 2.1 Introduction

**Summary:** The introduction establishes the context of natural language generation (NLG) tasks, highlighting the challenge of dealing with noisy and diverse training data. It argues that the widely used log loss is sensitive to outliers and can lead to models that replicate unwanted behaviors like hallucination. The authors propose loss truncation as a solution to this problem.

**Significant Citations:**

* **Claim:** "Existing training procedures for models seek to match the underlying distribution, leading to models that replicate and sometimes even amplify unwanted behaviors such as hallucination during generation."
    * **Citation:** (Tian et al., 2019; Wiseman et al., 2017; Lee et al., 2018)
    * **Relevance:** This citation supports the claim that existing NLG models often struggle with hallucination, motivating the need for a more robust training approach.
* **Claim:** "Existing work (Fan et al., 2018; Holtzman et al., 2019) has primarily addressed these issues by constructing decoders that implicitly remove unwanted variation when generating."
    * **Citation:** (Fan et al., 2018; Holtzman et al., 2019)
    * **Relevance:** This citation acknowledges prior work that focused on decoder modifications to improve generation quality, but positions the current work as addressing the root cause of the problem – the log loss function.
* **Claim:** "In this work, we argue that this phenomenon is not model specific, but is due to the widely-used log loss."
    * **Citation:** (Theis et al., 2016; Hashimoto et al., 2019; Gamon et al., 2005)
    * **Relevance:** This citation connects the problem of hallucination to the log loss function, setting the stage for the authors' proposed solution.


### 2.2 Motivation and Problem Statement

**Summary:** This section delves deeper into the limitations of log loss, particularly its sensitivity to noisy and invalid references. It uses a simple Gaussian mixture example to illustrate how log loss can lead to suboptimal models. The authors then introduce the concept of distinguishability as a more robust objective for NLG.

**Significant Citations:**

* **Claim:** "Log loss is not robust to noise. The KL divergence has intuitively correct behavior when each input x has a single correct reference y."
    * **Citation:** (Csiszar and Körner, 2011)
    * **Relevance:** This citation provides the theoretical foundation for understanding the behavior of KL divergence and its limitations in the presence of noise.
* **Claim:** "Distinguishability is defined as the error rate of an optimal classifier which seeks to distinguish samples from both the model and reference."
    * **Citation:** (Caccia et al., 2018)
    * **Relevance:** This citation formally defines distinguishability, which is a key concept in the paper's argument for a more robust loss function.
* **Claim:** "Distinguishability is both robust and provides sample quality guarantees, but is challenging to optimize."
    * **Citation:** (Caccia et al., 2018)
    * **Relevance:** This citation highlights the challenge of directly optimizing for distinguishability, motivating the authors' approach of using a surrogate loss function.


### 2.3 Loss Truncation

**Summary:** This section introduces the core idea of loss truncation, explaining its intuition and theoretical justification. It demonstrates how removing a fraction of high-loss examples can lead to tighter bounds on distinguishability.

**Significant Citations:**

* **Claim:** "We can show that this intuition is theoretically justified, and that truncating (i.e., removing) an appropriate c-fraction of the data provides tighter bounds on the distinguishability of the model."
    * **Citation:** (Donoho et al., 1988)
    * **Relevance:** This citation provides theoretical support for the idea that removing a fraction of noisy data can improve the robustness of the model.
* **Claim:** "This truncated bound can be substantially tighter than Pinsker's inequality."
    * **Citation:** (Csiszar and Körner, 2011)
    * **Relevance:** This citation highlights the advantage of the proposed loss truncation approach over the standard Pinsker's inequality, which relates KL divergence and distinguishability.


### 2.4 Implementing Truncation

**Summary:** This section details the training procedure for the loss truncation model, including hotstarting, quantile estimation, and loss dropping.

**Significant Citations:**

* **Claim:** "Hotstarting address two challenges in optimizing the truncated loss. First, losses are uninformative at the start of training so truncating examples based on these losses will result in dropping valid examples."
    * **Citation:** (Gehrmann et al., 2018)
    * **Relevance:** This citation justifies the use of hotstarting, which helps the model learn from the entire dataset before focusing on the truncated subset.
* **Claim:** "We evaluated on the Gigaword summarization task (Rush et al., 2017) as in Gehrmann et al. (2018)."
    * **Citation:** (Rush et al., 2017; Gehrmann et al., 2018)
    * **Relevance:** This citation establishes the experimental setup and the dataset used for evaluation, demonstrating the connection to prior work in the field.

    * **Relevance:** This citation establishes the experimental setup and the dataset used for evaluation, demonstrating the connection to prior work in the field.
* **Claim:** "HUSE measures distinguishability by learning a classifier over the log-probabilities and human evaluation scores over both samples from the model and references."
    * **Citation:** (Hashimoto et al., 2019)
    * **Relevance:** This citation explains the HUSE metric, which is a key evaluation metric used to assess the distinguishability of the generated text.
* **Claim:** "We also use HUSE to evaluate the quality-diversity tradeoffs of the models by estimating both HUSE-Q (which measures quality via human judgement) and HUSE-D (which measures diversity via statistical evaluation)."
    * **Citation:** (Hashimoto et al., 2019)
