    - The authors propose a new parameterization for the SSM, called Structured State Space (S4), which is more efficient while preserving the theoretical strengths of the SSM.
- **Significant Citations:**
    - **Claim:** Conventional models like RNNs, CNNs, and Transformers have specialized variants for capturing long dependencies, but they still struggle to scale to very long sequences.

        - **Citation:** [18]
        - **Relevance:** This citation introduces the LSSL as a theoretical foundation for the authors' work and highlights its potential for addressing LRDs.
