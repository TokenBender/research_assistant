    - **Claim:** "The recent work of Askell et al. (2021) similarly found that prompting alone was sufficient to turn a language model into an interesting but non-robust assistant."
    - **Citation:** (Askell et al., 2021)
    - **Explanation:** This citation highlights the findings of Askell et al. on the effectiveness of prompting for improving language model capabilities, while acknowledging the limitations of this approach.

**2.9 Discussion**

- **Key Points:** This section discusses the limitations and future directions for research on large language models. The authors highlight the need for more efficient architectures, address the challenges in evaluating toxicity and bias, and discuss the potential benefits and risks of using these models for AI safety.
- **Citations:**
    - **Claim:** "In this work we have taken a well established architecture and pushed model scale."
    - **Citation:** (Fedus et al., 2021; Lepikhin et al., 2021; Lin et al., 2021a; Vaswani et al., 2017)
    - **Explanation:** This citation highlights the current state-of-the-art in language model architectures and the trend of scaling model size.
    - **Claim:** "An alternative approach to sparsifying the linear maps is to split them into separate, conditionally activated experts (Fedus et al., 2021; Lepikhin et al., 2021; Lin et al., 2021a)."
    - **Citation:** (Fedus et al., 2021; Lepikhin et al., 2021; Lin et al., 2021a)
    - **Explanation:** This citation introduces the concept of sparse mixture of experts (MoE) as a technique for improving model efficiency.
    - **Claim:** "We separately consider a retrieval mechanism searching over the training set for relevant extracts during pre-training (Borgeaud et al., 2021), partially avoiding the need to memorise knowledge into network weights."
    - **Citation:** (Borgeaud et al., 2021)
    - **Explanation:** This citation introduces the concept of retrieval-based language models, which aim to improve efficiency by reducing the need for memorizing knowledge in network weights.
    - **Claim:** "While the Perspective API is a capable toxicity classifier (0.97 evaluation AUC7), toxicity classifiers can be subject to social bias, assigning higher toxicity to innocuous mentions of particular identity groups."
