- **Key Points:** The authors discuss the combined benefits of PR-MoE and MoS in conjunction with their DeepSpeed-MoE inference system, highlighting the reduction in the minimum number of GPUs required for inference and further improvements in latency and throughput.
- **Significant Citations:**
    - **Claim:** "For both Figures 12 and 13, we show a comparison of three model variants along with the baseline version (standard MoE on PyTorch): (i) the standard MoE Model denoted by MoE (DeepSpeed), (ii) the PR-MoE (DeepSpeed), and (iii) the PR-MOE+MoS (DeepSpeed)."

**5.5.4 Better Latency and Throughput Than Quality-Equivalent Dense Models**

- **Key Points:** The authors compare the inference performance of their MoE models with quality-equivalent dense models, demonstrating that DeepSpeed-MoE achieves significantly better latency and throughput compared to PyTorch for both billion-scale and trillion-scale models.
- **Significant Citations:**
    - **Claim:** "To better understand the inference performance of MoE models compared to quality-equivalent dense models, it is important to note that although MoE models are 5x faster and cheaper to train, that may not be true for inference. Inference performance has different bottlenecks and its primary factor is the amount of data read from memory instead of computation."
