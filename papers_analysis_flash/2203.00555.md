## 4. Experimental Methodology and Its Foundations

**Experimental Setup:**

The authors evaluate DEEPNET on various machine translation benchmarks, including IWSLT-14 De-En, WMT-17 En-De, and OPUS-100. They compare DEEPNET with several state-of-the-art Transformer models, including those using Post-LN, Pre-LN, and no LN. The experiments involve training models with varying depths and evaluating their performance using BLEU scores.

**Foundations:**

* **Machine Translation Benchmarks:** The authors use established benchmarks like IWSLT-14, WMT-17, and OPUS-100, which are commonly used in the NMT research community.
* **BLEU Score:** The evaluation metric used is BLEU score (Papineni et al., 2002), a standard metric for evaluating machine translation quality.

**Novel Aspects:**

The main novel aspect of the methodology is the introduction of DEEPNORM and its associated initialization scheme. The authors provide a theoretical justification for these novel approaches in Section 4.3, drawing upon the work of Zhang et al. (2019b) and Xiong et al. (2020) to support their claims.


## 5. Results in Context

**Main Results:**

* **DEEPNET outperforms state-of-the-art multilingual NMT models:** DEEPNET achieves a 5 BLEU point improvement over the 48-layer, 12B parameter M2M-100 model on a multilingual translation benchmark with 7,482 translation directions.
* **DEEPNET exhibits stable training across various depths:** The authors show that DEEPNET converges quickly and stably across a wide range of model depths, unlike some baseline models that diverge at deeper layers.
* **DEEPNET benefits from larger learning rates, batch sizes, and hidden dimensions:** The authors demonstrate that DEEPNET can be trained effectively with larger hyperparameter settings, leading to faster convergence and lower validation loss.

**Comparison with Existing Literature:**

* **Confirmation:** The results confirm the findings of previous work that better initialization can improve the stability of Transformer training (Zhang et al., 2019a,b; Huang et al., 2020).
