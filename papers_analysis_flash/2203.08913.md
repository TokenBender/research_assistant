### 2.1 Introduction

**Summary:** The introduction highlights the remarkable progress achieved by Transformers in NLP, mathematical reasoning, and program synthesis. However, it emphasizes the limitation of context length in attention mechanisms, which hinders performance on tasks requiring long-range dependencies. The authors propose using approximate kNN lookup into an external memory to extend the attention context and enable rapid learning by memorizing facts and information.

**Significant Citations:**

* **Claim:** "Attention over long sequences is also useful as a form of rapid learning. Facts and information which are stored in the form of weight matrices must be slowly trained over hundreds of thousands of training steps. By using attention, however, a model can simply memorize facts (e.g. function definitions) by storing them as (key, value) pairs in long-term memory, and then retrieve those facts later by creating a query that attends to them."
