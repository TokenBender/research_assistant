**2. Section-by-Section Analysis with Citation Extraction:**

**2.1 Introduction:**

- **Key Points:** The paper highlights the recent explosion in research surrounding large language models (LLMs), driven by the impressive performance of Transformer-based models like BERT, GPT-2, GPT-3, and T5. The authors emphasize the scaling law observed in LLMs, where performance scales predictably with the number of parameters. They note the scarcity of publicly available, large, dense autoregressive models and introduce GPT-NeoX-20B as a significant contribution to this space.
- **Citations:**
    - **Claim:** "One of the most impactful outcomes of this research has been the discovery that the performance of LLMs scales predictably as a power law with the number of parameters, with architectural details such as width/depth ratio having a minimal impact on performance within a wide range."
    - **Citation:** Kaplan, Jared, et al. "Scaling laws for neural language models." *arXiv preprint arXiv:2001.08361*, 2020.
    - **Relevance:** This citation supports the authors' claim about the scaling law observed in LLMs, which is a key motivation for their work.
    - **Claim:** "Today, there are dozens of publicly acknowledged LLMs in existence, the largest having more than two orders of magnitude more parameters than GPT-2, and even at that scale there are nearly a dozen different models. However, these models are almost universally the protected intellectual property of large organizations, and are gated behind a commercial API, available only upon request, or not available for outsider use at all."
    - **Citation:** Smith, et al. "Training Compute-Optimal Large Language Models." *arXiv preprint arXiv:2203.15556*, 2022.

**2.2 Model Design and Implementation:**

- **Key Points:** The paper describes the architecture of GPT-NeoX-20B, which largely follows GPT-3 but with notable deviations. These deviations include the use of rotary positional embeddings, parallel computation of attention and feed-forward layers, and a different initialization scheme. The authors also discuss the hardware and software setup used for training and evaluation.
- **Citations:**
    - **Claim:** "We use rotary embeddings (Su et al., 2021) instead of the learned positional embeddings used in GPT models (Radford et al., 2018), based on our positive prior experiences using it in training LLMs."
