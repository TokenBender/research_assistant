**2.1 Introduction:**

- **Key Points:**
    - The authors argue that using a single neural sequence model across tasks offers benefits like reducing the need for hand-crafted models, increasing training data diversity, and improving performance at the frontier of data, compute, and model scale.
    - They cite previous work showing that generic models often outperform specialized domain-specific approaches.
    - They introduce Gato, a general-purpose agent instantiated as a single, large transformer sequence model, capable of performing tasks like dialogue, image captioning, real-world robot control, and Atari game playing.
    - They hypothesize that training a generally capable agent on a large number of tasks is possible and that such an agent can be adapted with little extra data to succeed at even more tasks.
    - They emphasize the role of natural language as a common grounding across different embodiments, enabling combinatorial generalization to new behaviors.
    - They highlight the focus on model scale that allows real-time control of real-world robots and note the potential for further scaling as hardware and model architectures improve.

Furthermore, its performance continues to improve even at the frontier of data, compute and model scale (Kaplan et al., 2020; Hoffmann et al., 2022)."
