**2.2 Background and Related Work:**

- **Key Points:**
    - The paper draws upon three areas of research: metrics for quantifying differences between training examples, empirical observations of neural scaling laws, and the statistical mechanics of learning.
    - Existing data pruning metrics, such as EL2N, forgetting scores, memorization, and influence scores, have been explored but often require labels and scale poorly to ImageNet.
    - The authors highlight the lack of theoretical understanding of data pruning and the potential for exponential scaling.
- **Citations:**
    - **Claim:** Several recent works have explored various metrics for quantifying individual differences between data points.
    - **Citation:** [9, 10, 11]
    - **Explanation:** This citation introduces the concept of data pruning metrics and points to existing works that have explored different approaches.
    - **Claim:** Recent work has demonstrated that test loss often falls off as a power law with different resources like model parameters (N), number of training examples (P), and amount of compute (C).
    - **Citation:** [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
    - **Explanation:** This citation provides evidence for the widespread observation of power law scaling in deep learning, highlighting the relationship between resources and performance.
    - **Claim:** However, the exponents v of these power laws are often close to 0, suggesting potentially inefficient use of resources.
    - **Citation:** [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
    - **Explanation:** This citation emphasizes the inefficiency of power law scaling, suggesting that significant resource investments are required for relatively small performance gains.
    - **Claim:** Specifically for a large transformer based language model, Î½ = 0.095, which implies an order of magnitude increase in training data drops cross-entropy loss by only about 0.6 nats.
    - **Citation:** [2]
    - **Explanation:** This citation provides a specific example of the inefficiency of power law scaling in language modeling, highlighting the significant increase in data required for a relatively small improvement in error.
    - **Claim:** Interestingly, [8] explored a fixed computation budget C and optimized jointly over model size N and training set size P, revealing that scaling both N and P commensurately as C increases is compute optimal, and can yield smaller high performing models (trained on more data) than previous work.
    - **Citation:** [8]
    - **Explanation:** This citation highlights the potential of joint optimization of model size and training data size for efficient resource utilization.
    - **Claim:** While all of these results constitute significant improvements in performance, they do come at a substantial resource cost whose fundamental origin arises from power law scaling with small exponents.
    - **Citation:** [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
    - **Explanation:** This citation reiterates the inefficiency of power law scaling and emphasizes the need for alternative approaches to achieve better resource utilization.
    - **Claim:** Recent theoretical works have argued that the power law exponent is governed by the dimension of a data manifold from which training examples are uniformly drawn.
    - **Citation:** [23, 24, 25]
    - **Explanation:** This citation introduces the theoretical framework of data manifold dimension and its relationship to power law scaling.
