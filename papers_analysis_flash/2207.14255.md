## Analysis of "Efficient Training of Language Models to Fill in the Middle"

**1. Introduction:**

- **Title:** Efficient Training of Language Models to Fill in the Middle
- **Authors:** Mohammad Bavarian, Heewoo Jun, Nikolas Tezak, John Schulman, Christine McLeavey, Jerry Tworek, Mark Chen
- **Publication Date:** 28 Jul 2022
- **Objective:** The paper investigates the effectiveness of training autoregressive language models to fill in the middle of text (FIM) by simply moving a span of text from the middle to the end of a document. The authors aim to demonstrate that this data augmentation does not harm the original left-to-right generative capabilities of the model and can be learned "for free" during pretraining.

**2.5 Finetuning Results:**

- **Key Points:**
    - The authors investigate the effectiveness of finetuning existing AR models to learn FIM capabilities.
    - They find that finetuning is computationally inefficient compared to pretraining with FIM, requiring significantly more compute to achieve similar levels of performance.
- **Significant Citations:**
    - **Claim:** "Ideally, after finetuning, an AR model would reach the same level of performance on FIM evaluations as it would have achieved if it were pretrained with FIM. Given that FIM can be learned during pretraining without extra compute cost, it is natural to expect that the model should also be able to learn this task quickly in finetuning."

**2.6 Discussion:**

- **Key Points:**
    - The authors discuss potential explanations for the FIM-for-free property and the computational cost of learning FIM through finetuning.

    - The authors also discuss the inherent difficulty of FIM tasks compared to left-to-right generation, noting that FIM requires the model to plan a plausible narrative connecting the prefix and suffix, which can be challenging.
- **Significant Citations:**
    - **Claim:** "It is possible that there is ossification [Hernandez et al., 2021] in the learned document-wide attention pattern in regular AR pretraining which requires a lengthy finetuning stage to adapt to the attention pattern needed in FIM."
