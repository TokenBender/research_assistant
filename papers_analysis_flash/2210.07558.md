### 2.1 Introduction

**Summary:** The introduction highlights the increasing cost and resource demands of fine-tuning large pretrained models (PMs). It introduces LoRA as a parameter-efficient alternative but points out its limitations: fixed rank size and the need for exhaustive rank search during training. DyLoRA is presented as a solution that addresses these limitations by dynamically adapting to a range of ranks during training.

**Significant Citations:**

1. **Claim:** "With the ever-growing size of pretrained models (PMs), fine-tuning them has become more expensive and resource-hungry."
   - **Citation:** (Devlin et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020)
   - **Relevance:** This citation establishes the context of increasing model sizes and the associated computational costs, motivating the need for parameter-efficient techniques.
