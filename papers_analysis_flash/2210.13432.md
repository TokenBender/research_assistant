### 2.1 Introduction

**Summary:** The introduction highlights the advancements in natural language processing (NLP) due to LLMs trained with next-token prediction objectives like GPT-3 and PaLM. It emphasizes the impressive zero-shot and few-shot capabilities of these models but also points out their limitations in fine-tuning and perfect few-shot adaptation. The authors introduce their proposed method, Forgetful Causal Masking (FCM), which aims to address these limitations by randomly masking past tokens during training, encouraging attention to tokens in the distant past.

## 4. Experimental Methodology and Its Foundations

The paper's experimental setup utilizes the PaLM architecture as a base, modifying it with the proposed FCM and T-FCM techniques. The experiments are conducted on a variety of NLP tasks, including SuperGLUE, LAMBADA, StoryCloze, PIQA, ARC, OpenBookQA, Winograd, and others.

**Foundations:**

* The authors explicitly state that they use the PaLM architecture as a foundation (Chowdhery et al., 2022).
* The core methodology of FCM is inspired by dropout techniques (Srivastava et al., 2014) but applied specifically to the attention mechanism in a causal language model.
* The extension T-FCM is motivated by the observed performance gap between masked language models and causal language models (Wang et al., 2022; Tay et al., 2022).

**Novel Aspects:**

The primary novel aspect is the introduction of FCM, a simple yet effective pre-training technique that randomly masks past tokens during training. The authors justify this approach by hypothesizing that it encourages attention to tokens in the distant past, leading to better representations. The extension T-FCM, which introduces bidirectional context, is also a novel contribution.
