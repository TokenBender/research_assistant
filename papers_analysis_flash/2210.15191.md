### 3. Truncation as Desmoothing

**Summary:** This section introduces the core idea of the paper: viewing neural language models as a mixture of a true distribution and a smoothing distribution. It argues that truncation aims to "desmooth" the model's output, effectively recovering the support of the true distribution.

**Significant Citations:**

* **Claim:** "KL-divergence is known to be mode-covering; it heavily penalizes errors of coverage."
* **Citation:** None explicitly provided for this general concept, but it's a well-established property of KL-divergence in machine learning.
* **Relevance:** This claim is foundational to the paper's argument that language models, trained to minimize KL-divergence, tend to smooth out the true distribution, leading to the need for desmoothing through truncation.
* **Claim:** "Models incur large KL at test time when they place near zero probability on an observed word (Kang and Hashimoto, 2020)."
* **Citation:** Kang, D., & Hashimoto, T. (2020). Improved natural language generation via loss truncation. *Proceedings of the 58th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics*, 718-731.
* **Relevance:** This citation supports the idea that language models tend to assign non-zero probability to a wide range of words, even those unlikely in the true distribution, due to the penalty of infinite KL-divergence for zero probability. This motivates the need for truncation to remove this smoothing effect.
* **Claim:** "We present a framework for neural LMs wherein smoothing aids in KL-divergence minimization by placing a small amount of probability mass on all words."
* **Citation:** None directly provided for this specific framework, but it's a novel contribution of the paper.
* **Relevance:** This claim introduces the paper's core conceptual model, which is crucial for understanding the principles of truncation and the proposed η-sampling algorithm.


### 3.4 Principles for Truncation as Desmoothing

**Summary:** This section outlines two key principles for effective truncation: absolute probability and relative probability. These principles are derived from the smoothing model and aim to ensure that high-probability words are not truncated and that words are truncated based on their probability relative to the rest of the distribution.

**Significant Citations:**

* **Claim:** "Under our smoothing model (Section 3.2), a word outside the support of P*(Xi | x<i) has a bound on its probability: max Po(x|xi) ≤ (1 + 8)(1 − 1)/|V|."
* **Citation:** This is a direct consequence of the smoothing model proposed in Section 3.2.
* **Relevance:** This claim and the associated equation are crucial for establishing the absolute probability principle, which states that words with high probability should not be truncated.
* **Claim:** "The general principle is to only truncate words whose probabilities are also low relative to the rest of the distribution."
* **Citation:** This is a direct consequence of the smoothing model proposed in Section 3.2 and the relative probability principle.
* **Relevance:** This claim and the associated equation are crucial for establishing the relative probability principle, which states that words should be truncated based on their probability relative to the rest of the distribution, especially in high-entropy distributions.


### 3.5 Desmoothing and n-gram Models

**Summary:** This section illustrates the importance of desmoothing using the example of n-gram language models. It shows how smoothing with a uniform distribution can lead to nonsensical outputs when sampling outside the support of the n-gram model.

**Significant Citations:**

* **Claim:** "Text generated from unsmoothed n-gram models is locally coherent. However, we show that n-gram models smoothed with the uniform distribution generate nonsense (Figure 2)."
* **Citation:** None directly provided for this specific observation, but it's a novel contribution of the paper.
* **Relevance:** This claim and the accompanying figure demonstrate the negative impact of smoothing on text generation quality, further emphasizing the need for desmoothing techniques.
* **Claim:** "To avoid infinite perplexity (as the count estimates are zero almost everywhere), an n-gram model is explicitly smoothed (Katz, 1987; Church and Gale, 1991)."
* **Citation:**

* **Relevance:** These citations provide context for the smoothing techniques commonly used in n-gram models, highlighting the trade-off between avoiding infinite perplexity and potentially sacrificing text quality.


### 4. Methods

**Summary:** This section describes two popular truncation sampling algorithms (top-p and typical decoding) and their limitations in relation to the proposed principles of desmoothing. It then introduces the paper's proposed algorithm, η-sampling, which aims to address these limitations.

**Significant Citations:**

* **Claim:** "Top-p sampling breaks the absolute probability principle: words with up to (1 – p) probability may be truncated simply because other high-probability words cover probability p."
* **Citation:** Holtzman, A., Buys, J., Du, L., Forbes, M., & Choi, Y. (2020). The curious case of neural text degeneration. *International Conference on Learning Representations*.
* **Relevance:** This citation highlights a key limitation of top-p sampling, which violates the absolute probability principle by potentially truncating high-probability words.
* **Claim:** "Typical decoding is motivated by local informativeness: never generate words that are too surprising or too predictable (Meister et al., 2022a)."
* **Citation:** Meister, C., Pimentel, T., Wiher, G., & Cotterell, R. (2022). Typical decoding for natural language generation. *CoRR*, *abs/2202.00666*.
* **Relevance:** This citation introduces the concept of typical decoding and its motivation, which is based on local informativeness.
* **Claim:** "Our proposed algorithm, η-sampling, composes respect for both the absolute and relative probability principles."
* **Citation:** This is a novel contribution of the paper.
* **Relevance:** This claim introduces the paper's proposed algorithm, η-sampling, which is designed to satisfy both the absolute and relative probability principles for improved truncation.


### 5. Experiments & Results

**Summary:** This section presents the experimental setup and results of the paper. It compares the performance of η-sampling with top-p and typical decoding using automatic metrics (MAUVE) and human evaluations of text plausibility and repetition.
