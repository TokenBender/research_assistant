### 2.2 Speculative Decoding

This section introduces the core idea of speculative decoding, which leverages a more efficient approximation model to generate potential token sequences in parallel with the main model. It explains how the method ensures that the output distribution remains identical to that of the main model.

* **Claim:** "Speculative execution (Burton, 1985; Hennessy & Patterson, 2012) is an optimization technique, common in processors, where a task is performed in parallel to verifying if it's actually needed - the payoff being increased concurrency."

    * **Citation:** Hennessy, J. L., & Patterson, D. A. (2012). Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach. Morgan Kaufmann.
    * **Relevance:** This establishes the foundation of speculative execution, a well-known optimization technique in computer architecture, and connects it to the proposed method for accelerating inference.


* **Claim:** "With a novel sampling method, speculative sampling, we maximize the probability of these speculative tasks to be accepted, while guaranteeing that the outputs from our system have the same distribution as those from the target model alone."
    * **Relevance:** This introduces the novel "speculative sampling" method, which is crucial to the paper's contribution. It highlights the importance of ensuring that the speculative approach doesn't alter the output distribution.


### 2.3 Speculative Sampling

This section details the speculative sampling process, explaining how the approximation model's output is used to generate candidate tokens and how these candidates are evaluated by the main model. It also proves that the proposed method maintains the desired output distribution.

* **Claim:** "Given the distribution q(x) obtained from running Mq on a conditioning prefix, we can sample a token x₁ ~ q(x). We then calculate the distribution p(x) by running Mp on prefix while in parallel speculatively calculating the distribution of the next token x₂ by running Mp on prefix+[x1]."
    * **Relevance:** This explains the core logic of the speculative sampling process, where the approximation model's output is used to guide the parallel execution of the main model.


### 3. Analysis

This section delves into the theoretical analysis of the proposed method, including the expected number of tokens generated per iteration, the walltime improvement, and the impact on the number of arithmetic operations.

* **Claim:** "E(tokens per iteration) = 1-αγ+1 / 1-α"
    * **Relevance:** This equation provides a crucial theoretical result, quantifying the expected number of tokens generated per iteration of the speculative decoding algorithm. It's a key component in understanding the potential speedup.


* **Claim:** "The expected improvement factor in total walltime by Algorithm 1 is (1-αγ+1) / (1-α)(γ+1)."
    * **Relevance:** This theorem provides a theoretical estimate of the walltime improvement achieved by the speculative decoding method. It's a key result that justifies the authors' approach.


### 3.6 Approximation Models

This section discusses the choice of approximation models, emphasizing that the method works with any model and highlighting the effectiveness of using smaller Transformers or even simpler models like n-grams.

* **Claim:** "In our experiments, we mostly tested existing off-the-shelf smaller Transformers as the approximation models."
    * **Relevance:** This clarifies the practical implementation of the method, showing that it can leverage existing models without requiring extensive retraining.


### 4. Experiments

This section presents the experimental results, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method on various tasks and models.

* **Claim:** "We see that T5-small (77M), with a good balance of c and a, provides the highest speedup out of the tested approximation models."
    * **Relevance:** This highlights a key finding from the experiments, showing that a smaller, well-chosen approximation model can lead to the best performance gains.


### 5. Related Work

This section positions the authors' work within the broader context of existing research on accelerating inference in large language models.

* **Claim:** "Numerous techniques try to make inference more efficient for all tokens, e.g. distillation (Hinton et al., 2015), sparcification (Jaszczur et al., 2021), quantization (Hubara et al., 2016), and architecture modification (So et al., 2021; Shazeer, 2019)."
