### 2.1 Introduction

- **Key Points:** The introduction highlights the growing interest in large language models (LLMs) due to advancements like GPT-2, GPT-3, InstructGPT, and ChatGPT. It emphasizes the concept of in-context learning and chain-of-thought prompting as key developments. However, it also points out the fundamental limitation of LLMs as finite automata due to their bounded input length, restricting their computational power. Finally, it introduces the idea of augmenting LLMs with external memory to potentially overcome this limitation.

### 2.2 Stored Instruction Computer

- **Key Points:** This section introduces the concept of a stored instruction computer (SIC) as a way to augment LLMs with external memory. The SIC acts as a simple CPU, with the LLM acting as the processing unit and an associative memory serving as RAM. The interaction between the LLM and memory is kept simple, relying on regular expressions for parsing and processing. The goal is to demonstrate computational universality without modifying the LLM's weights.

    c. **Relevance:** This citation establishes the historical foundation for the SIC architecture, referencing von Neumann's seminal work on computer architecture, which laid the groundwork for modern computer design.


### 2.3 Post Processing Language Model Outputs

- **Key Points:** This subsection details how the output of the LLM is parsed using regular expressions to extract variable assignments, which are then stored in the associative memory. It also describes how variable substitution is handled within the values.

- **Significant Citations:** (No direct citations in this subsection)


### 2.4 Pre Processing Language Model Inputs

- **Key Points:** This subsection explains how the input prompt for the LLM is retrieved from a specific memory location (op) and how memory values are spliced into the prompt using regular expressions. It also mentions the use of nested substitutions for convenience.

- **Significant Citations:**

    a. **Claim:** "Note that, technically, allowing arbitrarily nested substitutions can simulate a context free grammar [Sipser, 2013], which violates the constraint of finite state computation; however, we will only use bounded depth nesting (depth bound 2) below to ensure the pre and post processing steps all remain achievable by finite state computation."
    b. **Citation:** Sipser, M. (2013). Introduction to the Theory of Computation.
    c. **Relevance:** This citation acknowledges the theoretical connection between nested substitutions and context-free grammars, but emphasizes that the approach remains within the bounds of finite state computation due to the limited nesting depth.


### 2.5 Compute Cycle

- **Key Points:** This section describes the main loop of the SIC, which retrieves the next instruction from memory, processes it (including splicing in memory values), passes it to the LLM, parses the LLM's output, updates memory based on the output, and repeats until a halt instruction is encountered.

- **Significant Citations:** (No direct citations in this subsection)


### 3. Universal Turing Machine

- **Key Points:** This section provides a formal definition of a Turing machine, a theoretical model of computation that is considered computationally universal. It introduces the concept of a universal Turing machine, which can simulate any other Turing machine. The paper focuses on a specific universal Turing machine, U15,2, which is known to be Pareto optimal in terms of state and symbol count.

## 4. Experimental Methodology and Its Foundations

- **Experimental Setup:** The authors use a specific LLM (Flan-U-PaLM 540B) and design a stored instruction computer (SIC) architecture. The SIC utilizes regular expressions for parsing and processing LLM outputs and inputs. The LLM's decoding temperature is set to zero to ensure deterministic behavior. The authors then test the system's ability to simulate the U15,2 universal Turing machine by providing a series of input prompts corresponding to the Turing machine's states and symbols.

- **Foundations:**
    - The SIC architecture is based on the concept of a stored instruction computer, as described in von Neumann's work [von Neumann, 1945].
    - The choice of U15,2 as the target Turing machine is based on its Pareto optimality in terms of state and symbol count [Neary and Woods, 2009].
    - The use of regular expressions for parsing is a standard technique in computer science and language processing.

- **Novel Aspects:** The novel aspect of the methodology is the combination of a pre-trained LLM with a simple SIC to achieve computational universality. The authors don't cite any specific work justifying this novel combination, but it builds upon the existing research on LLMs, in-context learning, and the theoretical foundations of computation.


## 5. Results in Context

- **Main Results:** The paper demonstrates that Flan-U-PaLM 540B, when augmented with the SIC, can successfully simulate the U15,2 universal Turing machine. This is achieved by verifying that the LLM produces the correct output for all 29 possible (state, symbol) combinations.

- **Comparison with Existing Literature:**
    - The results confirm the theoretical possibility of achieving computational universality in LLMs when augmented with external memory.
    - The results contrast with previous work on computational universality in neural networks, which often involved modifying the network's weights. This paper shows that universality can be achieved without altering the LLM's weights.

- **Confirmation/Contradiction/Extension:**
    - The results confirm the Church-Turing thesis, which states that all computational mechanisms are equivalent to a Turing machine.
    - The results extend the understanding of LLMs by demonstrating their potential for general-purpose computation when augmented with external memory.
