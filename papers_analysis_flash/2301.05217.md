**2. Section-by-Section Analysis with Citation Extraction:**

**2.1 Introduction:**

- **Key Points:**
    - Neural networks often exhibit emergent behavior, where new capabilities arise from scaling up model size, training data, or training steps. [Steinhardt, 2022; Wei et al., 2022a]
    - This has led to breakthroughs in in-context learning and chain-of-thought prompting. [Radford et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020; Wei et al., 2022b]
    - However, scaling can also lead to emergent reward hacking. [Pan et al., 2022]
    - Emergence is most surprising when it is abrupt, as in the case of reward hacking, chain-of-thought reasoning, or other phase transitions. [Ganguli et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2022a]
    - Understanding these phase transitions requires finding hidden progress measures. [Barak et al., 2022]
    - The paper proposes a different approach to uncovering hidden progress measures: via mechanistic explanations. [Cammarata et al., 2020; Elhage et al., 2021]
    - The paper focuses on grokking, where models abruptly transition to a generalizing solution after a large number of training steps, despite initially overfitting. [Power et al., 2022]
    - The paper studies modular addition, where a model takes inputs a, b ∈ {0,..., P – 1} for some prime P and predicts their sum e mod P. [Power et al., 2022]
    - Small transformers trained with weight decay on this task consistently exhibit grokking.

**2.2 Related Work:**

    - The paper highlights the Circuits approach of mechanistic interpretability. [Cammarata et al., 2020; Elhage et al., 2021; Olsson et al., 2022]
    - The paper discusses the concept of progress measures. [Barak et al., 2022]

**2.3 Setup and Background:**

- **Key Points:**
    - The paper describes the experimental setup for training transformers on modular addition.
    - The paper uses a one-layer ReLU transformer with token embeddings, learned positional embeddings, attention heads, and a hidden MLP layer.
    - The paper uses full batch gradient descent with the AdamW optimizer. [Loshchilov & Hutter, 2017]
    - The paper trains the model for 40,000 epochs and evaluates test loss and accuracy on all pairs of inputs not used for training.
    - The paper notes that networks trained on this task consistently exhibit grokking.

**2.4 The Fourier Multiplication Algorithm:**

- **Key Points:**
    - The paper proposes a Fourier multiplication algorithm that the learned networks use to perform modular addition.
    - The algorithm involves mapping inputs to sines and cosines at key frequencies, combining them using trigonometric identities, and then reading off the logits for each output.

**2.5 Reverse Engineering a One-Layer Transformer:**

- **Key Points:**
    - The paper provides four lines of evidence to support the claim that the transformers are using the Fourier multiplication algorithm.
    - The first line of evidence is the consistent periodic structure observed in the network weights and activations.
    - The second line of evidence is the analysis of the network weights, showing that the unembedding matrix is rank 10 and that the MLP layer computes sums of sinusoidal functions.
    - The third line of evidence is the analysis of individual neurons, showing that they are well-approximated by degree-2 polynomials of sines and cosines at a single frequency.
    - The fourth line of evidence is the use of ablations, where components of the model are replaced with components of the Fourier multiplication algorithm, confirming that the interpretation is faithful.

**2.6 Suggestive Evidence: Surprising Periodicity:**

- **Key Points:**
    - The paper highlights the surprising periodicity observed in the activations of the transformer.
    - This periodicity is observed in the embeddings, attention heads, MLP neuron activations, and logits.

**2.7 Mechanistic Evidence: Composing Model Weights:**

- **Key Points:**
    - The paper demonstrates that the model implements the trigonometric identity for computing cos(wk(a + b)) and sin(wk(a + b)) in the MLP activations.
    - The paper shows that the unembedding matrix reads these linear directions and multiplies them by cos(wkc) and sin(wkc) respectively.

**2.8 Zooming In: Approximating Neurons with Sines and Cosines:**

- **Key Points:**
    - The paper shows that the attention heads and most neurons are well-approximated by degree-2 polynomials of sines and cosines at a single frequency.
    - The paper highlights the localization of computations across frequencies and the alignment of neuron basis with the model's computations.

**2.9 Correctness Checks: Ablations:**

- **Key Points:**
    - The paper performs ablations to confirm that the approximations of model components are faithful.
    - The paper replaces MLP neuron activations with their polynomial approximations, showing that this does not harm performance.
    - The paper ablates key frequencies in the Fourier space of the logits, confirming that they are necessary for the model's performance.
    - The paper ablates all other frequencies, showing that this actually improves performance.

- **Key Points:**
    - The paper identifies three phases of training: memorization, circuit formation, and cleanup.
    - The paper describes the characteristics of each phase in terms of the progress measures.

**2.13 Grokking and Weight Decay:**

- **Key Points:**
    - The paper provides evidence that weight decay is an important component of grokking.
    - The paper shows that smaller amounts of weight decay lead to slower grokking, while larger amounts lead to faster grokking.
    - The paper shows that grokking does not occur without weight decay or some other form of regularization.

**3. Key Insights and Supporting Literature:**

- **Key Insight 1:** Grokking is not a sudden shift, but rather a gradual amplification of structured mechanisms encoded in the weights, followed by the later removal of memorizing components.
