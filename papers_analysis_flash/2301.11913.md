**2.1. Introduction:**

- **Key Points:** The authors highlight the increasing reliance on large language models (LLMs) in deep learning applications, leading to high training costs due to the need for specialized HPC clusters.

    - **Explanation:** This citation introduces the concept of "collaborations" as another approach to training large models, further expanding the scope of potential training environments.
    - **Claim:** "However, training in either of those setups requires specialized algorithms that can adapt to the changing number of workers, utilize heterogeneous devices and recover from hardware and network failures. While there are several practical algorithms for unreliable hardware (Kijsipongse et al., 2018; Lin et al., 2020; Ryabinin et al., 2021), they can only train relatively small models that fit into the memory of the smallest device. This limits the practical impact of cost-efficient strategies, because today's large-scale experiments often involve models with billions of parameters."

They discuss the limitations of these techniques in terms of communication overhead, scalability, and fault tolerance, particularly in the context of unreliable and heterogeneous devices.
- **Citations:**
    - **Claim:** "Traditional model parallelism. Historically, the first general strategy for training large models was to assign each device to compute a subset of each layer (e.g., a subset of neurons), then communicate the results between each other (Krizhevsky et al., 2012; Ben-Nun & Hoefler, 2019; Tang et al., 2020)."

    - **Explanation:** This citation introduces traditional model parallelism, a technique that partitions the model across devices, but suffers from high communication overhead.
    - **Claim:** "As a result, while intra-layer parallelism is still widely used (Shazeer et al., 2018; Rajbhandari et al., 2020), it is usually applied within one physical server in combination with other strategies (Krizhevsky, 2014; Chilimbi et al., 2014; Jia et al., 2019; Narayanan et al., 2021)."

    - **Explanation:** This citation highlights the limitations of traditional model parallelism, leading to its use within a single server in combination with other techniques.
    - **Claim:** "Pipeline parallelism circumvents the need for expensive all-to-all communication by assigning each device with one or several layers (Huang et al., 2019)."

    - **Explanation:** This citation introduces pipeline parallelism, a technique that reduces communication overhead by assigning layers to different devices in a sequential manner.
    - **Claim:** "To better utilize the available devices, the pipeline must process multiple microbatches per step, allowing each stage to run in parallel on a different batch of inputs. In practice, the number of microbatches is limited by the device memory: this results in reduced device utilization when processing the first and the last microbatches, known as the "bubble" overhead (Huang et al., 2019)."

    - **Explanation:** This citation discusses the "bubble" overhead associated with pipeline parallelism, a limitation that reduces device utilization.
    - **Claim:** "Aside from model parallelism, there two more strategies for training large models: data parallelism with dynamic parameter loading (Rajbhandari et al., 2020) and model-specific algorithms such as Mixture-of-Experts (Shazeer et al., 2017)."

    - **Claim:** "We discuss these algorithms in Appendix B and compare the performance of offloading with SWARM in Section 4.2 and Appendix E."
    - **Explanation:** This statement indicates that the authors will further discuss these alternative approaches in the appendices, providing a more comprehensive overview of related work.

**2.3. Communication Efficiency and Compression:**

- **Key Points:** The authors discuss techniques for improving communication efficiency in distributed training, including gradient compression and overlapping computation with communication.
- **Citations:**
    - **Claim:** "Efficient gradient communication. Data-parallel training requires synchronization of gradients after each backward pass, which can be costly if the model has many parameters or the network bandwidth is limited. There exist several methods that approach this problem: for example, Deep Gradient Compression (Lin et al., 2018) sparsifies the gradients and corrects the momentum after synchronization, while PowerSGD (Vogels et al., 2019) factorizes the gradients and uses error feedback to reduce the approximation error. Recently, Wang et al. (2022) proposed to compress the changes of model activations, achieving high-speed communication for finetuning models of up to 1.5B parameters. Alternatively, Dettmers (2016) uses 8-bit quantization to compress gradients before communication. We evaluate it along with compression-aware architectures, leaving the exploration of more advanced approaches to future work."

URL https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkhQHMW0W.
    - **Explanation:** This citation introduces gradient compression techniques, such as Deep Gradient Compression and PowerSGD, which aim to reduce communication overhead in data-parallel training.
    - **Claim:** "Besides gradient compression, another effective technique is to use layer sharing (Lan et al., 2020), which reduces the number of aggregated gradients by a factor of how many times each layer is reused."

    - **Explanation:** This citation introduces layer sharing, a technique that reduces communication overhead by reusing layers in the model, further enhancing communication efficiency.
    - **Claim:** "Overlapping communication and computation. Model, pipeline, and data parallelism all have synchronization points and require transfer of gradients or activations. One way to reduce the transfer cost is to overlap communication with computation, hiding the synchronization latency. This overlap can be achieved by combining parallelism techniques (Krizhevsky, 2014; Rajbhandari et al., 2020), by synchronizing gradients layer-by-layer in lockstep with backpropagation (Paszke et al., 2019), or by using pure pipeline parallelism (Huang et al., 2019; Narayanan et al., 2019). However, pure pipeline parallelism requires many stages to effectively hide the latency. To overcome this problem, we study inter-layer compression techniques that work well even with relatively few pipeline stages."

    - **Explanation:** This citation introduces the concept of overlapping communication and computation, a technique that aims to reduce synchronization latency by performing communication and computation concurrently.

**3. Communication-Efficient Model Parallelism:**

- **Key Points:** The authors introduce their proposed approach for training large models on unreliable, heterogeneous, and poorly connected devices. They analyze the scaling properties of existing model-parallel algorithms and introduce the "Square-Cube Law" of distributed training, which suggests that communication overhead can decrease with increasing model size. They then present SWARM parallelism, a decentralized model-parallel algorithm designed for these challenging conditions.
- **Citations:**
    - **Claim:** "We analyze the existing model-parallel algorithms and show conditions where training increasingly larger models leads to less intense network usage."
    - **Explanation:** This statement sets the stage for the authors' analysis of the scaling properties of existing model-parallel algorithms, leading to the introduction of the "Square-Cube Law."
    - **Claim:** "We develop SWARM parallelism, a decentralized model-parallel algorithm²that leverages randomized fault-tolerant pipelines and dynamically rebalances nodes between pipeline stages. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first decentralized algorithm capable of billion-scale training on heterogeneous unreliable devices with slow interconnect."
    - **Explanation:** This statement introduces SWARM parallelism, the paper's main contribution, highlighting its novel features and potential for training large models in challenging environments.

**3.1. The Square-Cube Law of Distributed Training:**

- **Key Points:** The authors present a simplified model of pipeline parallelism to analyze the scaling properties of communication and computation costs with increasing model size. They derive the "Square-Cube Law," which states that computation costs grow faster than communication costs with increasing model size, leading to a decrease in communication overhead for larger models.
- **Citations:**
    - **Claim:** "This principle applies to many real-world neural network architectures, albeit with some confounding variables. In convolutional neural networks (Fukushima, 1980), the computation time scales as O(BHWC2) and the communication is O(BHWC), where B, H, W and C stand for batch size, height, width and the number of channels."
    - **Citation:** Fukushima, K. (1980). Neocognitron: A self-organizing neural network model for a mechanism of pattern recognition unaffected by shift in position. Biological Cybernetics, 36:193-202.
    - **Explanation:** This citation provides an example of a real-world neural network architecture (convolutional neural networks) that exhibits the square-cube law, supporting the authors' argument.
    - **Claim:** "Based on these observations, we conclude that pipeline parallelism naturally grows more communication-efficient with model size. More precisely, increasing the hidden dimension will reduce the communication load per device per unit of time, making it possible to train the model efficiently with lower network bandwidth and higher latency³. While the exact practical ramifications depend on the use case, Section 4.1 demonstrates that some of the larger models trained with pipeline parallelism can already train at peak efficiency with only hundreds of Mb/s bandwidth."
    - **Explanation:** This statement summarizes the key insight of the "Square-Cube Law," highlighting its implications for training large models with limited network bandwidth.

**3.2. SWARM Parallelism:**

- **Key Points:** The authors describe SWARM parallelism, a decentralized model-parallel algorithm that addresses the limitations of traditional pipeline parallelism by introducing stochastic wiring and adaptive rebalancing. Stochastic wiring allows for dynamic routing of microbatches between peers, maximizing device utilization and mitigating network latency. Adaptive rebalancing dynamically adjusts the pipeline stages based on peer performance, ensuring efficient utilization of heterogeneous devices and resilience to failures.
- **Citations:**
    - **Claim:** "Traditional pipeline parallelism can be communication-efficient, but this alone is not enough for our setups. Since training devices can have different compute and network capabilities, a pipeline formed out of such devices would be bottlenecked by the single “weakest link", i.e., the participant with the smallest training throughput. As a result, the more powerful nodes along the pipeline would be underutilized due to either lack of inputs or slow subsequent stages. On top of that, if any node fails or leaves training prematurely, it will stall the entire training procedure."
    - **Explanation:** This statement highlights the limitations of traditional pipeline parallelism in the context of heterogeneous and unreliable devices, motivating the need for SWARM parallelism.
    - **Claim:** "To overcome these two challenges, we replace the rigid pipeline structure with temporary “pipelines” that are built stochastically on the fly during each iteration. Each participant can send their outputs to any peer that serves the next pipeline stage. Thus, if one peer is faster than others, it can process inputs from multiple predecessors and distribute its outputs across several weaker peers to maximize utilization. Also, if any participant disconnects, its predecessors can reroute their requests to its neighbors. New peers can download up-to-date parameters and optimizer statistics from remaining workers at the chosen stage. This allows the training to proceed as long as there is at least one active participant per stage: we elaborate on the fault tolerance of SWARM parallelism in Appendix A."
    - **Explanation:** This statement describes the key features of SWARM parallelism, including stochastic wiring and adaptive rebalancing, highlighting its ability to handle heterogeneous devices and failures.

**4. Experimental Methodology and Its Foundations:**

- **Experimental Setup:** The authors conduct experiments to evaluate the communication efficiency of SWARM parallelism at scale, comparing its performance with existing model-parallel algorithms (GPipe and ZeRO-Offload) in both ideal and realistic conditions. They use a variety of model architectures (Transformer, BERT, and ALBERT) and hardware configurations (V100 and A100 GPUs) with varying network bandwidth and latency.
- **Foundations:**
    - **Claim:** "Before we can meaningfully evaluate SWARM parallelism, we must verify our theoretical observations on communication efficiency. Here we run several controlled experiments that measure the GPU utilization and network usage for different model sizes, using the Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017) that has been widely adopted in various fields (Lin et al., 2022)."

To fit into the GPU memory for the "GPT-3" configuration, we offload the optimizer into RAM using ZeRO-Offload. Before averaging, we use PyTorch's built-in All-Reduce to aggregate gradients. We evaluate both the standard GPipe schedule and the 1F1B schedule (Narayanan et al., 2019)."

    - **Claim:** "For "xxlarge", we use the official implementation from (Ren et al., 2021). However, for "GPT-3", we found that optimizer offloading still does not allow us to fit 4 layers into the GPU. For this reason, we also offload the model parameters using the offload_param option."

    - **Explanation:** This citation provides the foundation for the authors' comparison of SWARM parallelism with ZeRO-Offload, using the official implementation of ZeRO-Offload for benchmarking.

**5. Results in Context:**

- **Main Results:**
    - The authors demonstrate that SWARM parallelism achieves high training throughput on heterogeneous and unreliable devices with limited network bandwidth, outperforming GPipe and ZeRO-Offload in certain scenarios.
    - They validate the "Square-Cube Law" of distributed training, showing that communication overhead decreases with increasing model size.
    - They evaluate the effectiveness of adaptive rebalancing in SWARM parallelism, demonstrating its ability to maintain high throughput in the presence of failures.
    - They explore the impact of compression-aware architectures on training performance, finding that 8-bit quantization achieves comparable performance to the baseline, while bottleneck and maxout compression can improve communication efficiency but may slightly degrade model accuracy.
- **Comparison with Existing Literature:**
    - **Claim:** "We evaluate how SWARM parallelism compares to existing systems for training large models: GPipe (Huang et al., 2019) and ZeRO-Offload (Ren et al., 2021)."
