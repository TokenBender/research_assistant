   - **Citation:** None explicitly provided for this general concept, but it's a well-established concept in GPU computing.
   - **Relevance:** This statement emphasizes the importance of GEMM input shapes for achieving optimal INT4 performance.

3. **Claim:** "We adopt the system optimizations described in (Yao et al., 2022) and (Aminabadi et al., 2022) when applicable, and take advantage of FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022) and the CUDA graph (NVIDIA, 2021) to further improve the performance."
