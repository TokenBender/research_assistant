### 2.1 Introduction

**Summary:** The introduction highlights the advancements of transformer-based large language models (LLMs) in various generation tasks, particularly strongly conditioned ones. However, it emphasizes the issue of degeneration in open-ended generation, where deterministic decoding methods often produce repetitive and dull outputs. Stochastic methods are presented as a potential solution, but the paper focuses on understanding the degeneration phenomenon through the lens of entropy.

### 2.2 Stable Entropy Analysis

**Summary:** This section introduces the concept of stable entropy and the stable entropy zone. It defines entropy in the context of language models and explains how it can be smoothed to reduce variance. The authors then present empirical evidence showing that the mean entropy of a language model remains relatively stable over the length of the generation, forming a narrow band around the baseline.

**Significant Citations:**

* **Claim:** "The entropy of the model can suffer from high variance (See Figure 1)."
    * **Citation:** (No direct citation, but Figure 1 is referenced)
    * **Relevance:** This claim and the accompanying figure highlight the need for smoothing the entropy, which is a crucial step in the analysis.
* **Claim:** "We now define the stable entropy baseline as the mean smoothed entropy at timestep t under the target context distribution at time t, w₁ ∈ D: μぇ(t; D, po) = Ew‡∈D [H(po, w₁)]."
    * **Citation:** (Equation 3 in the paper)
    * **Relevance:** This equation formally defines the stable entropy baseline, a core concept in the paper's hypothesis.


### 2.3 Stable Entropy Hypothesis

**Summary:** This section introduces the Stable Entropy Hypothesis (SEH), which posits that high-quality, coherent, and "human-like" text generation is associated with maintaining the generated text's entropy within the stable entropy zone. The authors present empirical evidence supporting this hypothesis by showing a correlation between entropy violations and lower generation quality metrics.

**Significant Citations:**

* **Claim:** "We hypothesize that decoding algorithms whose generation's smoothed entropy stays mostly enclosed within the stable entropy zone will produce higher quality, coherent, less repetitive, and more “human-like" text."
    * **Citation:** (No direct citation, but the hypothesis is introduced in this section)
    * **Relevance:** This statement formally introduces the SEH, which is the central argument of the paper.
* **Claim:** "We observe that Mauve scores have a strong negative correlation (p = −0.92) with the entropy violation ratio (EVR)."
    * **Citation:** (Figure 4a in the paper)
    * **Relevance:** This finding provides empirical support for the SEH, demonstrating that lower generation quality (as measured by Mauve) is associated with higher entropy violations.


### 3. Entropy-Aware Decoding

**Summary:** This section introduces the proposed entropy-aware decoding (EAD) algorithm. The algorithm aims to maintain the generated text's entropy within the stable entropy zone by intervening when the entropy deviates significantly from the baseline. It uses a combination of greedy decoding and sampling to achieve this goal.

**Significant Citations:**

* **Claim:** "These stochastic methods, though, rely on uniform random sampling at each time step, which might results in generation being less contextual and more factually inaccurate (Lee et al., 2022)."
