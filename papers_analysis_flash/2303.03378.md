    * **Relevance:** This statement highlights the diversity of tasks used for evaluation, including both planning and question-answering tasks.


* **Claim:** "PaLM-E is integrated into the control loop to execute the plans in the real world, and has to adjust the plan in presence of external disturbances or failures of the low-level control policies."
    * **Relevance:** This statement emphasizes the closed-loop nature of the experiments in the Language-Table and Mobile Manipulation environments, where PaLM-E's decisions are executed by a robot, and the robot's actions can lead to new observations that require replanning.


### 2.7 Summary of Experiments & Discussion

**Summary:** This section summarizes the key findings of the experiments, including the benefits of transfer learning across tasks, the impact of model size, and the effectiveness of PaLM-E in various embodied and general vision-language tasks. It also discusses the implications of the results for future research.

**Significant Citations:**

* **Claim:** "As summarized in Fig. 3, we have shown several instances of transfer in this work, meaning that PaLM-E trained on different tasks and datasets at the same time leads to significantly increased performance relative to models trained separately on the different tasks alone."
    * **Relevance:** This statement summarizes a key finding of the paper, highlighting the benefits of co-training across multiple tasks.


* **Claim:** "In Fig. 4, co-training on the 'full mixture' achieves more than double the performance."
    * **Relevance:** This statement provides a specific example of the benefits of co-training, showing a significant improvement in performance when training
