## 2. Section-by-Section Analysis with Citation Extraction

### 2.1 Introduction

**Summary:** The introduction highlights the limitations of traditional autoregressive language models (LMs) that only consider the preceding context during training and inference. It introduces the concept of MIM, which aims to improve data efficiency and LM capabilities for infilling by jointly training two models (forward and backward) and encouraging them to agree on their predictions.

**Significant Citations:**

1.  **Claim:** "Most LMs have to be able to generate the next token from the sequence of previous tokens."

        - Brown et al., 2020, "Language Models are Few-Shot Learners", NeurIPS.
    - **Explanation:** The authors argue that the standard autoregressive training objective ignores the suffix information, leading to inefficient use of training data. MIM addresses this by incorporating the suffix through a second, backward model, effectively providing a denser supervision signal.
- **Insight 2:** MIM enhances the capabilities of LMs for the infilling task by utilizing context from both sides of the insertion point.
    - **Supporting Citations:**

        - Bavarian et al., 2022, "Efficient Training of Language Models to Fill in the Middle", arXiv preprint.
    - **Explanation:** The authors demonstrate that the proposed inference procedure, which allows the forward and backward models to "meet in the middle", leads to better infilling results compared to FIM, which only considers concatenated prefix and suffix.
- **Insight 3:** The agreement regularizer in MIM improves the quality of autoregressive generation and enhances the efficiency of infilling.
