## 4. Experimental Methodology and Its Foundations

- **Experimental Setup:** The authors used GPT-2 Small and GPT-3 XL models, pre-trained on the Pile dataset. They employed unstructured weight sparsity during pre-training and transitioned to dense fine-tuning on various downstream tasks (E2E, WebNLG, DART, and Curation Corpus). The experiments were conducted on the Cerebras CS-2 hardware.
- **Foundations in Cited Works:**
    - The authors based their pre-training methodology on the standard autoregressive language modeling objective [Bengio et al., 2003].

    - The fine-tuning setup was inspired by [Hu et al., 2022] and [Li and Liang, 2021a].
- **Novel Aspects:** The core novelty lies in the SPDF framework, which decouples model capacity between pre-training and fine-tuning by using unstructured weight sparsity during pre-training and then transitioning to dense fine-tuning. The authors justify this approach based on the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis [Frankle and Carbin, 2018] and the observation that full model capacity is often not required for downstream tasks.
