## 4. Experimental Methodology and Its Foundations

**Experimental Setup:**

The paper evaluates Reflexion across three main task domains:

1. **Decision-Making:** Using the AlfWorld environment, which involves solving multi-step tasks in text-based environments.
2. **Reasoning:** Using the HotPotQA dataset, which involves answering complex questions based on Wikipedia articles.
3. **Programming:** Using HumanEval, MBPP, and a new benchmark called LeetcodeHardGym, which involves generating code to solve programming problems.

The core methodology involves an iterative process where the agent:

1. Generates a trajectory of actions in the environment.
2. Receives feedback (either binary or textual) from the environment or an evaluator.
3. Verbally reflects on the feedback and stores it in a memory buffer.
4. Uses the stored reflections as context for future actions.
