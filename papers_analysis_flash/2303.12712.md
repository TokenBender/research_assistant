    - **Relevance:** This claim introduces the authors' focus on the limitations of the autoregressive architecture in terms of working memory and planning.

**8.2 Lack of Planning in Arithmetic/Reasoning Problems:**

- **Key Points:** This section further explores GPT-4's limitations with working memory and planning, focusing on arithmetic and reasoning problems. The authors demonstrate that GPT-4 struggles with even simple arithmetic problems that require multiple steps, suggesting that its working memory is limited and that it lacks the ability to plan ahead.
- **Significant Citations:**
    - **Claim:** "One might argue that in the above example, the amount of “inner memory” needed is quite large (at least in the sense that a human would probably have to use a scratchpad)."
    - **Citation:** None
    - **Relevance:** This claim acknowledges the potential for GPT-4 to have a limited working memory, similar to the limitations of human working memory.

**8.3 Lack of Planning in Text Generation:**

- **Key Points:** This section explores GPT-4's limitations with planning in the context of text generation, highlighting its challenges with handling global constraints that require long-range interactions between different parts of the text. The authors argue that GPT-4's autoregressive architecture may be a limiting factor in handling these types of constraints.
- **Significant Citations:**
    - **Claim:** "The tasks we consider here can be thought of as content generation under constraints, asking the model to generate textual content according to specific instructions which include constraints on its structure."
    - **Citation:** None
    - **Relevance:** This claim introduces the authors' focus on evaluating GPT-4's ability to handle text generation under constraints.

**9. Societal Influences:**

- **Key Points:** This section discusses the potential societal influences of GPT-4 and its successors, highlighting the need for careful consideration of both the benefits and costs of this technology. The authors explore various topics, including the potential for job displacement, the spread of misinformation, and the creation of an "AI divide."
- **Significant Citations:**
    - **Claim:** "Uses of GPT-4 and its successors will no doubt have significant social and societal influences."
    - **Citation:** None
    - **Relevance:** This claim introduces the authors' focus on the potential societal influences of GPT-4 and its successors.

**9.1 Challenges of Erroneous Generations:**

- **Key Points:** This section discusses the challenges posed by erroneous generations, or hallucinations, in GPT-4 and other LLMs. The authors highlight the need for careful review of generated content, especially in high-stakes applications, and explore potential mitigation strategies for addressing hallucinations.
- **Significant Citations:**
    - **Claim:** "In Section 1, we discussed a key limitation of LLMs as their tendency to generate errors without warning, including mathematical, programming, attribution, and higher-level conceptual errors."
    - **Citation:** None
    - **Relevance:** This claim introduces the authors' focus on the challenges posed by erroneous generations, or hallucinations, in
