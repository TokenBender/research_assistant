**2. Section-by-Section Analysis with Citation Extraction:**

**2.1. Introduction:**

- **Key Points:**
    - Large language models (LLMs) are typically trained densely, requiring synchronization across thousands of GPUs, which is expensive and inefficient.
    - Branch-Train-Merge (BTM) alleviates this cost by dividing compute among smaller expert language models (ELMs) trained on distinct subsets of the corpus.
    - BTM relies on document metadata to identify domains, which is not always available and limits its applicability.
    - The paper introduces C-BTM, a metadata-free algorithm that uses unsupervised clustering to discover domains and train specialized ELMs on each cluster.
- **Significant Citations:**
    - **Claim:** "Large language models (LLMs) are typically trained densely: all parameters are updated with respect to all inputs."

**2.2. C-BTM Training Process:**

- **Key Points:**
    - C-BTM uses k-means clustering to discover domains within a corpus.
    - Each cluster is assigned to a separate ELM, which is initialized from a seed language model and trained on the cluster's data.
    - The trained ELMs are combined into a sparse ensemble for inference.

        - **Citation:** Zhang et al., 2022
        - **Relevance:** This citation introduces OPT as the seed language model used in the experiments, highlighting the importance of using a pre-trained model for initializing ELMs.

**2.3. C-BTM Inference Process:**

- **Key Points:**
    - C-BTM uses a sparse ensemble of ELMs for inference, activating only the top-k experts based on the distance between the current context and each expert's cluster center.
    - This approach enables efficient sparse computation by retrieving only the top-k experts for each new token.

**2.4. Comparing to Dense Training:**

- **Key Points:**
    - Dense LLMs are typically trained using hundreds or thousands of GPUs, requiring significant communication overhead.
    - C-BTM reduces communication overhead by training ELMs asynchronously, only requiring communication between GPUs training the same ELM.
    - C-BTM improves the resiliency of distributed training by mitigating the impact of GPU failures.

        - **Relevance:** The paper does not explicitly cite a specific work for the concept of communication overhead in distributed training, suggesting it is a well-understood concept in the field.

**2.5. Comparing to BTM:**

- **Key Points:**
    - BTM is limited to training data with metadata, which is not always available in large-scale text corpora.
    - BTM relies on cached prior estimation for ensemble weights, which requires additional data and forward passes through experts.

    - **Claim:** "Moreover, BTM inference follows the cached prior method introduced by Gururangan et al. (2022), where the ensemble weights are estimated using Bayes' rule on additional held out data, and the prior P(D = j) is estimated with an exponential moving average over sequences of posterior estimates that require forward passes on experts."
        - **Citation:** Gururangan et al., 2022
        - **Relevance:** This citation introduces the cached prior method used by BTM, highlighting its limitations in terms of data requirements and computational cost.

**2.6. Comparing to Mixture-of-Experts (MoE):**

    - C-BTM routes sequences instead of tokens using offline balanced clustering, eliminating the need for online load balancing and reducing communication overhead.
    - C-BTM avoids expensive all-to-all operations between experts and naturally leads to interpretable expert specialization.
- **Significant Citations:**
    - **Claim:** "Like MoE models (e.g., Fedus et al., 2022), C-BTM allows for efficient scaling of large LMs while keeping inference costs manageable."
        - **Citation:** Fedus et al., 2022
