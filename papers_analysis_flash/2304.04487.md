### 2.1 Introduction

**Summary:** The introduction highlights the growing use of large language models (LLMs) in various applications and the increasing concern about their high deployment cost, particularly due to the computational burden of autoregressive decoding. It introduces the concept of exploiting overlaps between LLM outputs and readily available references (e.g., retrieved documents in search engines) to accelerate inference.

**Significant Citations:**

* **Claim:** "While there are general methodologies that help reduce the serving cost of LLMs such as quantization (Dettmers & Zettlemoyer, 2023), pruning (Frantar & Alistarh, 2023), compression (Xu et al., 2020) and distillation (Wang et al., 2020), the inference efficiency bottleneck of these transformer-based generative models (e.g., GPT) is mainly associated with autoregressive decoding: at test time, output tokens must be decoded (sequentially) one by one, which poses significant challenges for the LLMs to be deployed at scale."

### 2.2 Method

**Summary:** This section details the proposed LLMA method, which leverages the overlap between LLM outputs and reference documents. It first provides background on stepwise decoding in autoregressive language models and then introduces the LLMA algorithm. LLMA identifies matching text spans between the generated output and reference documents, copies these spans into the decoder input, and efficiently checks their validity in parallel.

## 4. Experimental Methodology and Its Foundations

**Experimental Setup:** The experiments are conducted using the LLaMA language model and the MS-MARCO dataset. The authors evaluate LLMA's performance in three scenarios: retrieval-augmented generation, cache-assisted generation, and multi-turn conversations. They use a grid search to determine the optimal hyperparameters for LLMA and compare its performance to a baseline greedy decoding method.

**Foundations:**

* The authors draw upon their previous work on aggressive decoding (Sun et al., 2021; Ge et al., 2022) as a foundation for LLMA.
* They also acknowledge the related work on speculative decoding (Xia et al., 2022a) and speculative sampling (Chen et al., 2023) but highlight the simplicity and ease of implementation of LLMA.
* The use of the Huggingface Transformers library (Wolf et al., 2020) and the accelerate library (Gugger et al., 2022) is also a key aspect of the methodology, enabling efficient implementation and scaling of the experiments.


**Novel Aspects:** The core novelty of the methodology lies in the introduction of the copy mechanism and the efficient parallel checking of copied tokens within the decoding process. The authors justify this approach by highlighting the natural overlaps between LLM outputs and references in various application scenarios.


## 5. Results in Context
