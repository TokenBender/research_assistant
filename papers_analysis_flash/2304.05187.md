### 2.1 Introduction

**Summary:** The introduction highlights the challenges associated with hyperparameter tuning in deep learning, emphasizing the computational cost and impact on reproducibility and scientific understanding of generalization. It introduces the concept of automatic gradient descent (AGD) as a solution to these problems, emphasizing that deep learning should not inherently require hyperparameter tuning. The authors introduce the core tools used in their derivation: Bregman divergence and deep relative trust.
