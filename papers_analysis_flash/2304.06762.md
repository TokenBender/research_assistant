### 2.1 Introduction

**Summary:** The introduction establishes the context of large language models (LLMs), highlighting the success of autoregressive models like GPT-3 and GPT-4 in text generation and in-context learning. It then discusses the limitations of these models, including high parameter counts, difficulty in maintaining factual accuracy, and challenges in updating knowledge. The authors introduce retrieval-augmented LMs as a potential solution to these issues, referencing prior work that integrated retrieval at fine-tuning or inference stages. Finally, they introduce RETRO (Borgeaud et al., 2022) as a scalable approach for pretraining with retrieval and pose the central research question: should we pretrain autoregressive LLMs with retrieval by default?

**Novel Aspects of Methodology:**

* **Reproducing and Pretraining RETRO from Scratch:** This is a significant contribution, as the original RETRO implementation and pretrained checkpoints were not publicly available.
* **"Left Padding" Rule for Maintaining Causality:** The authors introduce and explain the "left padding
