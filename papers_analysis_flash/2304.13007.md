**2. Section-by-Section Analysis with Citation Extraction:**

**2.1 Introduction:**

- **Key Points:**
    - Existing chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting methods often rely on self-consistency (SC), which samples multiple chains and aggregates their final answers.
    - SC has limitations:
        - It may not produce a clear majority answer when the output space is large.
        - It discards valuable information present in intermediate reasoning steps.
        - It lacks interpretability as there's no single reasoning chain to explain the final answer.
- **Significant Citations:**
    - **Claim:** CoT prompting has been shown to dramatically improve performance on reasoning-heavy tasks.
        - **Citation:** (Kojima et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2022)
        - **Relevance:** This citation supports the claim that CoT is a valuable technique for improving reasoning abilities in LLMs.
    - **Claim:** Sampling multiple chains of thought and returning their majority output further improves accuracy.
