## 4. Experimental Methodology and Its Foundations

**Experimental Setup:** The paper evaluates the performance of MMDBs using two datasets: Rotowire and T-REx. The Rotowire dataset consists of basketball game reports and associated tables, while the T-REx dataset is a collection of Wikipedia abstracts and Wikidata tables. The authors compare the performance of MMDBs with a baseline approach using text-to-table [43].

**Foundations:**

* The authors utilize the TaBERT model [44] as the foundation for their MMDB-Model.
* The experimental methodology is inspired by existing work in the field of text-to-table generation [43].
* The authors introduce novel pre-training objectives (CTA, MCR, DD) to enhance the MMDB-Model's ability to extract tabular data from text. These novel approaches are justified by the need to address the specific challenges of multi-modal database operations.


## 5. Results in Context

**Main Results:**

* MMDBs consistently outperform text-to-table in terms of accuracy, especially when limited training data is available.
* MMDBs are computationally more efficient than text-to-table, particularly for complex queries and operations like joins and unions.
* The MMDB-Model can be effectively used in zero-shot and few-shot scenarios, achieving high accuracy on new text collections with minimal fine-tuning.
* Multi-modal materialized views and secondary indexes significantly improve query performance in MMDBs.

**Comparison with Existing Literature:**

* The authors compare their results with text-to-table [43], a state-of-the-art approach for text-to-table generation.
* The results demonstrate that MMDBs achieve better accuracy and efficiency compared to text-to-table, particularly in scenarios with limited training data.
* The authors' findings confirm the potential of LLMs for extracting structured data from text, extending the work of previous studies like TaBERT [44].
