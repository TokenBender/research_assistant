## 4. Experimental Methodology and Its Foundations

**Experimental Setup:**

The authors evaluate SearChain on a variety of complex knowledge-intensive tasks, including multi-hop question answering (HotpotQA, Musique, WikiMultiHopQA, StrategyQA), slot filling (zsRE, T-REX), fact checking (FEVER), and long-form question answering (ELI5). They use gpt-3.5-turbo as the LLM and ColBERTv2 as the retrieval model. The evaluation metrics include cover-EM for most tasks and ROUGE-L for ELI5. They compare SearChain's performance with a range of baselines, including methods that focus on improving LLM reasoning abilities (CoT, Auto-CoT, Least-to-Most) and methods that integrate IR (Direct Retrieval, Self-Ask, ToolFormer, React, DSP).

**Foundations:**

* **Chain-of-Thought Prompting:** The authors draw inspiration from the Chain-of-Thought prompting technique [36] to encourage LLMs to generate a reasoning chain.
* **Retrieval-Augmented Language Models:** The authors build upon the concept of Retrieval-Augmented Language Models [10, 12, 18] to integrate external knowledge into the LLM's reasoning process.
* **In-Context Learning:** The authors leverage in-context learning [36] to guide the LLM's generation of the CoQ and to incorporate IR feedback.
* **Depth-First Search:** The authors introduce a novel "node-identify" variant of Depth-First Search [31] to enable dynamic modification of the reasoning path.


**Novel Aspects:**

The most novel aspects of the methodology are:

* **Chain-of-Query (CoQ) Generation:** The use of a global reasoning chain to decompose complex questions.
* **Interactive Verification and Completion:** The selective use of IR feedback to correct errors and provide missing knowledge.
* **Tree-Based Reasoning Path:** The transformation of the reasoning path from a chain to a tree structure, enabling dynamic modification of the reasoning direction.

The authors cite relevant works to justify these novel approaches, as discussed in the previous sections.


## 5. Results in Context
