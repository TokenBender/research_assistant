### 2.1 Introduction

**Summary:** The introduction highlights the challenges of privacy in distributed machine learning, leading to the emergence of Federated Learning (FL). It then discusses the limitations of fully supervised FL in real-world scenarios due to the cost of data labeling, motivating the use of semi-supervised learning (SSL). Existing FedSSL methods rely on the closed-world assumption, which is often unrealistic. The paper introduces the open-world setting, where unseen classes can exist in unlabeled data, and proposes a new FedSSL benchmark and framework (FedoSSL) to address the challenges of biased training in this setting.
