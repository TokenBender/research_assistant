### 2.1 Introduction

**Summary:** This section introduces the limitations of standard transformers in handling long input sequences due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention. It highlights the need for specialized long-context models that sparsify or approximate attention, but emphasizes that these models still struggle with extremely long inputs (e.g., exceeding 500k tokens). The authors then introduce Unlimiformer as a solution to this problem.

### 2.2 Unlimiformer

**Summary:** This section details the core idea of Unlimiformer: injecting a k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) search into each decoder layer of a pretrained transformer. Instead of attending to all encoder keys, each attention head retrieves its top-k nearest neighbors from a pre-computed index of encoder hidden states. This allows the model to effectively attend to relevant information across the entire input sequence, even if it's much longer than the model's original context window.

**Significant Citations:**

* **Claim:** "Other architectures such as Longformer-Encoder-Decoder (LED; Beltagy et al., 2020) can leverage pretrained models, but they still need to further train new position embeddings or global attention weights, which is computationally and environmentally costly."
    * **Citation:** Beltagy, I., Peters, M. E., & Cohan, A. (2020). Longformer: The long-document transformer. *arXiv preprint arXiv:2004.05150*.
    * **Relevance:** This citation highlights a competing approach (LED) and its limitations, emphasizing the computational cost associated with adapting pretrained models for long inputs. This sets the stage for Unlimiformer's advantage of being a non-parametric approach.
* **Claim:** "We introduce Unlimiformer, a retrieval-based approach to augment pretrained language models to accept inputs of unbounded length at test time. Given a long input sequence, Unlimiformer constructs a k-nearest-neighbor (kNN) index over the hidden states of all input tokens."

    * **Relevance:** This citation introduces the concept of using a kNN index for retrieval in the context of long-document understanding, which is a key component of Unlimiformer's methodology.
* **Claim:** "The index can be stored in either GPU or CPU memory, needs to hold only a single vector per input token, and can be queried in sublinear time."
    * **Citation:** Johnson, J., Douze, M., & Jégou, H. (2019). Billion-scale similarity search with GPUs. *IEEE Transactions on Big Data*, *7*(3), 535–547.
    * **Relevance:** This citation justifies the efficiency of using a kNN index for retrieval, emphasizing that it can be queried in sublinear time, which is crucial for handling long sequences.


### 2.3 Encoding

**Summary:** This subsection describes how the input sequence is encoded into chunks using the pretrained model's encoder. Overlapping chunks are used to ensure sufficient context, and only the middle half of each chunk's encoded vectors is retained. These encoded vectors are then indexed using a kNN index (e.g., Faiss).

**Significant Citations:**

* **Claim:** "To encode an input sequence that is longer than the model's context window, we use the given model's encoder to encode overlapping chunks of the input, following Ivgi et al. (2022)."
    * **Citation:** Ivgi, M., Shaham, U., & Berant, J. (2022). Efficient long-text understanding with short-text models.
    * **Relevance:** This citation explicitly acknowledges the source of the chunking strategy used for encoding long inputs, demonstrating that the authors are building upon existing work in the field.
* **Claim:** "Finally, we index the encoded inputs in a kNN index, using a library such as Faiss (Johnson et al., 2019), using dot-product as the index's nearest-neighbor similarity metric."
    * **Citation:** Johnson, J., Douze, M., & Jégou, H. (2019). Billion-scale similarity search with GPUs. *IEEE Transactions on Big Data*, *7*(3), 535–547.
    * **Relevance:** This citation explicitly mentions the use of Faiss, a popular library for efficient nearest-neighbor search, and highlights the use of dot-product as the similarity metric for the kNN index.


### 2.4 Retrieval-Augmented Cross-Attention

**Summary:** This subsection explains how the standard cross-attention mechanism is modified in Unlimiformer. Instead of attending to all encoder keys, each attention head retrieves the top-k keys from the kNN index and performs attention only on these retrieved keys. This significantly reduces computational cost while preserving most of the attention mass.

**Significant Citations:**

* **Claim:** "In standard cross-attention, a transformer decoder attends to the encoder's top-layer hidden states, where the encoder usually truncates the input and encodes only the k first tokens in the input sequence."
    * **Citation:** Vaswani, A., Shazeer, N., Parmar, N., Uszkoreit, J., Jones, L., Gomez, A. N., ... & Polosukhin, I. (2017). Attention is all you need. *Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems*, *30*.
    * **Relevance:** This citation provides the context of standard cross-attention in transformers, which Unlimiformer modifies to improve efficiency for long inputs.
* **Claim:** "Instead of attending only to this k-token prefix of the input, we retrieve the top-k hidden states from the kNN index for each cross-attention head, and attend only to these top-k."
    * **Citation:** Wu, Y., Rabe, M. N., Hutchins, D., & Szegedy, C. (2022). Memorizing transformers. *International Conference on Learning Representations*.
    * **Relevance:** This citation connects Unlimiformer's approach to the work of Memorizing Transformers, which also uses a kNN index for retrieval, but in a different way. Unlimiformer's reformulation of the attention mechanism is a key contribution that addresses the limitations of Memorizing Transformers.


### 2.5 Attention Reformulation

**Summary:** This subsection presents a mathematical reformulation of the standard dot-product attention mechanism. This reformulation allows Unlimiformer to use a single kNN index across all attention heads and decoder layers, significantly reducing the memory footprint and complexity of the retrieval process.

**Significant Citations:**

* **Claim:** "Instead, we present a different order of computing the well-known transformer attention formula, which allows us to store a single index across all attention heads and all decoder layers, without changing the mathematical definition of the transformer's standard dot-product attention."
    * **Citation:** Wu, Y., Rabe, M. N., Hutchins, D., & Szegedy, C. (2022). Memorizing transformers. *International Conference on Learning Representations*.
    * **Relevance:** This citation acknowledges the connection to Memorizing Transformers, but also highlights the novel contribution of Unlimiformer's attention reformulation, which enables the use of a single index across all heads and layers.


### 3. Training Unlimiformer

**Summary:** This section explores different training strategies for Unlimiformer, ranging from low-cost methods (applying Unlimiformer only at validation or test time) to more computationally intensive methods (training Unlimiformer directly).

**Significant Citations:**

* **Claim:** "Unlimiformer can be used, at test time, with an already-trained model, and lead to gains without further training, as we show later in Table 3."

## 4. Experimental Methodology and Its Foundations

**Experimental Setup:**

The authors evaluate Unlimiformer on three long-document and book summarization datasets: GovReport, SummScreen, and BookSum. They compare Unlimiformer's performance against several baselines, including BART, PRIMERA, SLED, and Memorizing Transformers. They explore various training strategies, including low-cost methods (applying Unlimiformer only at validation or test time) and more computationally intensive methods (training Unlimiformer directly). They use standard evaluation metrics like ROUGE and BERTScore to assess the quality of the generated summaries.

**Foundations in Cited Works:**

* **Chunking and Encoding:** The authors leverage the chunking strategy from Ivgi et al. (2022) to handle long inputs, encoding them in overlapping chunks and retaining only the middle portion of each chunk's encoded representation.
* **kNN Index:** They utilize a kNN index, implemented using Faiss (Johnson et al., 2019), to efficiently retrieve the top-k most relevant encoder hidden states for each attention head.
* **Attention Reformulation:** The authors reformulate the standard dot-product attention mechanism to enable the use of a single kNN index across all attention heads and decoder layers, inspired by the work of Wu et al. (2022) on Memorizing Transformers.

**Novel Aspects of Methodology:**

* **Non-Parametric Approach:** Unlimiformer is a non-parametric approach, meaning it doesn't introduce any new trainable parameters. This allows it to be easily applied to existing pretrained models without requiring extensive retraining. The authors cite Ivgi et al. (2022) to justify the benefits of this approach in the context of long-context models.
* **Single Index for All Heads and Layers:** The attention reformulation allows Unlimiformer to use a single kNN index across all attention heads and decoder layers, which is a significant improvement over previous retrieval-based approaches (e.g., Memorizing Transformers) that required separate indices for each head and layer. The authors don't explicitly cite a work to justify this specific approach, but it's a novel contribution of the paper.


## 5. Results in Context

**Main Results:**

* Unlimiformer consistently improves the performance of various pretrained transformer models on long-document and book summarization tasks, even without further training.
* Unlimiformer achieves significant gains in ROUGE and BERTScore scores compared to baselines like BART and PRIMERA.
* Unlimiformer can be effectively combined with other long-context models (e.g., PRIMERA) to further enhance performance.
* The computational cost of Unlimiformer increases sublinearly with input length, making it feasible for handling very long sequences.

**Comparison with Existing Literature:**

* **Confirmation:** The results confirm the findings of Ivgi et al. (2022) that efficient long-text understanding can be achieved using short-text models with retrieval mechanisms.
* **Extension:** Unlimiformer extends the work of Wu et al. (2022) on Memorizing Transformers by using a single kNN index across all attention heads and decoder layers, leading to improved efficiency and performance.

* **Non-Parametric:** Unlimiformer doesn't introduce any new trainable parameters, allowing it to leverage existing pretrained models without retraining.
* **Efficiency:** Unlimiformer's attention reformulation enables the use of a single kNN index across all attention heads and decoder layers, leading to improved efficiency compared to previous retrieval-based approaches.


## 7. Future Work and Open Questions

**Suggested Future Research:**

* **Exploring Different Languages:** The authors suggest extending their work to other languages beyond English.
* **Multi-GPU Training:** They propose investigating the use of multi-GPU training to handle even longer input sequences during training.
* **Optimizing Index Storage:** They suggest exploring alternative index storage strategies to reduce the latency associated with offloading the index to the CPU.

**Supporting Citations:**

The authors don't explicitly cite any specific works to support these suggestions for future work, but they are based on the limitations and challenges identified in the paper and are common research directions in the field of long-context transformers.


## 8. Critical Analysis of Citation Usage

**Effectiveness of Citation Usage:**

The authors generally use citations effectively to support their claims and findings. They provide a clear context for their work by referencing relevant prior research in the areas of long-range transformers and retrieval-augmented transformers. They acknowledge the contributions of previous work and highlight the novelty of their own approach.

**Areas for Improvement:**

* **More Context for Attention Reformulation:** While the authors connect their attention reformulation to the work of Wu et al. (2022), they could provide more detailed explanations and potentially cite additional works that explore alternative ways of reformulating attention mechanisms for efficiency.
* **Discussion of Related Work on Chunking:** The authors briefly mention the chunking strategy from Ivgi et al. (2022), but they could expand on the discussion of related work on chunking techniques for long inputs in transformers.

**Potential Biases:**

The authors primarily cite works from the NLP and deep learning communities, which is appropriate given the focus of the paper.
