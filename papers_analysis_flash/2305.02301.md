    * **Explanation:** These citations provide the datasets used in the experiments, which demonstrate the data efficiency of the proposed method. The results show that "Distilling step-by-step" can achieve comparable or better performance than LLMs with significantly less training data.
* **Insight:** "Distilling step-by-step" allows the use of significantly smaller models to achieve comparable or better performance than LLMs.
