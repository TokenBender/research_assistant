- **Foundations in Cited Works:**
    - **Dimensionality Reduction:** The authors cite works on t-SNE, UMAP, and PCA as the basis for their dimensionality reduction techniques.
    - **Transformer Models:** The authors use pre-trained implementations of BERT, GPT-2, and ViT, which are based on the original papers introducing these models.
- **Novel Aspects:** The core novelty lies in the visualization technique itself: visualizing the joint embedding of query and key vectors. The authors don't explicitly cite any specific work that directly inspired this approach, suggesting it's a novel contribution. The normalization techniques (key translation and query/key scaling) are also novel contributions to improve the interpretability of the visualizations.


**5. Results in Context**

- **Main Results:**
    - AttentionViz reveals specialized attention heads in ViT that focus on specific visual features like hue and brightness.
    - AttentionViz reveals positional attention patterns and task-specific behavior in BERT.
    - AttentionViz reveals anomalies in GPT-2, such as norm disparities and a tendency to primarily attend to the first token.
- **Comparison with Existing Literature:**
    - The authors compare their findings on the role of transformer layers in capturing positional information with previous work by Lin et al. (2019), Clark et al. (2019), and Vig (2019).
    - The authors compare their findings on the behavior of GPT-2 with previous work by Vig and Belinkov (2019).
- **Confirmation, Contradiction, or Extension:**
    - The authors' findings on the role of transformer layers in capturing positional information generally confirm previous work.
    - The authors' findings on the anomalous behavior of GPT-2 extend previous work by highlighting specific instances of unexpected behavior.


**6. Discussion and Related Work**

- **Situating the Work:** The authors situate their work within the broader context of transformer interpretability, highlighting the need for tools that can help researchers understand the inner workings of these complex models. They emphasize the limitations of existing visualization techniques and argue that AttentionViz offers a novel and valuable approach for exploring global attention patterns.
