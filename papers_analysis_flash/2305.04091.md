## 4. Experimental Methodology and Its Foundations

**Experimental Setup:**

The authors evaluate their proposed PS and PS+ prompting methods on ten benchmark datasets across three reasoning categories: arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning. They utilize the GPT-3 language model (specifically, the text-davinci-003 engine) for all experiments. The primary evaluation metric is accuracy on each dataset.

**Foundations in Cited Works:**

* **CoT Prompting:** The authors build upon the foundation of chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting (Wei et al., 2022b), which involves providing a few examples of step-by-step reasoning to guide the LLM.
* **Zero-shot CoT:** They extend this concept to zero-shot CoT (Kojima et al., 2022), which eliminates the need for manual examples by simply adding a trigger phrase like "Let's think step-by-step" to the prompt.
* **Program of Thought (PoT):** The authors also compare their method to Zero-shot-PoT (Chen et al., 2022), which uses LLMs to generate Python code to solve problems.
* **Few-shot CoT:** They compare their zero-shot approach to few-shot CoT methods, including Manual-CoT (Wei et al., 2022b) and Auto-CoT (Zhang et al., 2022), which use manually crafted or automatically selected examples, respectively.

**Novel Aspects of Methodology:**

The core novelty of the paper lies in the introduction of PS and PS+ prompting. The authors justify these novel approaches by highlighting the limitations of existing CoT prompting methods, particularly the issues of calculation errors, missing steps, and semantic misunderstandings. They argue that by explicitly prompting the LLM to devise a plan and execute it step-by-step, they can improve the quality of the generated reasoning process and reduce these errors.
