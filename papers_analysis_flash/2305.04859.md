## 4. Experimental Methodology and Its Foundations

**Experimental Setup:**

The authors evaluate Random Padding using three pre-trained language models (BERT, RoBERTa, and ELECTRA) on the TriviaQA dataset. They create two types of datasets: one with truncated contexts to a fixed length and another with contexts truncated to a range of lengths. They conduct experiments under two main conditions: "train short, test long" and "train and test with similar context lengths." Random Padding is implemented by randomly moving padding tokens to the front of the input sequence during fine-tuning.

**Foundations in Cited Works:**

* **BERT's Input Processing:** The authors follow BERT's original input processing, including the use of special tokens ([CLS], [SEP]) and padding, as described in Devlin et al. (2019).
* **Fine-tuning for QA:** The fine-tuning process for extractive QA, including the update of position embeddings only for non-padding tokens, is based on the standard practice described in Devlin et al. (2019).
* **Adam Optimizer:** The authors use the Adam optimizer (Kingma & Ba, 2015) for fine-tuning, a common practice in deep learning.

**Novel Aspects of Methodology:**

The core novelty lies in the **Random Padding** technique. The authors don't modify the architecture of the PLMs but introduce a simple data augmentation strategy during fine-tuning. They justify this approach by arguing that it helps balance the updating frequency of position embeddings, addressing the issue of under-trained rear position embeddings.


## 5. Results in Context

**Main Results:**

* Random Padding consistently improves the performance of extractive QA models when trained on short contexts and evaluated on longer ones.
* The improvement is more pronounced when answers are located at the end of contexts.
* Random Padding also provides some benefits when training and testing sets have similar context length distributions.
* The effectiveness of Random Padding can be reduced when models are trained on longer contexts or in low-resource scenarios.

**Comparison with Existing Literature:**

* **Confirmation:** The results confirm the hypothesis that insufficient fine-tuning of rear position embeddings can lead to performance degradation in QA, as suggested by the pilot experiment and related work on "train short, test long" scenarios (Su et al., 2021; Press et al., 2022).
* **Extension:** The authors extend the existing literature by demonstrating that a simple data augmentation technique like Random Padding can effectively mitigate this issue without requiring architectural changes to the PLMs.
