    - **Claim:** We investigate the reasoning capabilities of StarCoderBase on GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021), a set of middle-school math word problems.
    - **Citation:** Cobbe et al., 2021
    - **Relevance:** This citation introduces the GSM8K benchmark used for evaluating math reasoning capabilities.
    - **Claim:** MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2020) is a massive multitask language understanding benchmark, covering multiple-choice questions in 57 knowledge domains, including the humanities, STEM, and social sciences.
    - **Citation:** Hendrycks et al., 2020
    - **Relevance:** This citation introduces the MMLU benchmark used for evaluating world knowledge and reading comprehension capabilities.
    - **Claim:** CoQA (Reddy et al., 2019) is a large-scale dataset for Conversational Question Answering systems, measuring the model's ability to process a text passage and answer a series of interconnected questions.
    - **Citation:** Reddy et al., 2019
    - **Relevance:** This citation introduces the CoQA benchmark used for evaluating conversational question answering capabilities.
    - **Claim:** Recent work has highlighted that LLMs often capture social biases and stereotypes from their pre-training corpora (Kurita et al., 2019; May et al., 2019; Hutchinson et al., 2020; Meade et al., 2023).
    - **Citation:** Kurita et al., 2019; May et al., 2019; Hutchinson et al., 2020; Meade et al., 2023
    - **Relevance:** This citation highlights the potential for LLMs to exhibit social bias.
    - **Claim:** To evaluate toxicity in responses generated from our model, we use RealToxicityPrompts (Gehman et al., 2020), a collection of sentence-level prompts that often elicit undesirable responses from language models.
    - **Citation:** Gehman et al., 2020
    - **Relevance:** This citation introduces the RealToxicityPrompts benchmark used for evaluating the models.

**2.21 Reasoning Tasks in HELM:**

- **Key Points:** This section evaluates the performance of StarCoderBase on a wide range of natural language reasoning tasks from the HELM benchmark. The authors compare the performance of their model with other open-access and closed-access models, highlighting the strengths and limitations of their model.
- **Significant Citations:**
    - **Claim:** We evaluate StarCoderBase with HELM (Liang et al., 2022), an evaluation suite aiming to increase the transparency of LLMs by reporting their performance on a wide range of tasks.
