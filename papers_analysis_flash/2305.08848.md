* **GLUE:** The authors use RoBERTa-large as the plug-in model and GPT-3.5 as the LLM.
* **XNLI:** They use XLM-V as the plug-in model and GPT-3.5 as the LLM.
* **Methodology:** The core of the methodology involves:
    1. Fine-tuning a smaller model (plug-in) on the entire training dataset.
    2. Constructing a context by randomly sampling examples from the training data and including the plug-in model's predictions and confidence scores.
    3. Concatenating the test input with the context and plug-in model's prediction for the test input.
    4. Using the LLM to generate the final prediction and optional explanation.

**Foundations in Cited Works:**

* The authors use RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019) and XLM-V (Liang et al., 2023) as plug-in models, citing these works to establish the foundation of their chosen models.
* The concept of fine-tuning is a standard practice in deep learning, and the authors don't explicitly cite a specific work for this.
* The concept of in-context learning is based on the work of Brown et al. (2020), which is cited throughout the paper.
* The use of confidence scores as a measure of uncertainty is a common practice in machine learning, and the authors don't explicitly cite a specific work for this.

**Novel Aspects of Methodology:**
