    - **Citation:** N/A
    - **Relevance:** This statement introduces the section's focus on prompting strategies for multiple-choice question answering.
    - **Claim:** "Few-shot prompting Few-shot prompting [19] involves prompting an LLM by prepending example inputs and outputs before the final input. Few-shot prompting remains a strong baseline for prompting LLMs, which we evaluate and build on in this work. We use the same few-shot prompts as used by Singhal et al. [1]."

        - Singhal et al., 2022, Large Language Models Encode Clinical Knowledge, arXiv preprint arXiv:2212.13138
    - **Relevance:** This citation introduces the concept of few-shot prompting and its relevance to the paper's work.
    - **Claim:** "Chain-of-thought Chain-of-thought (CoT), introduced by Wei et al. [42], involves augmenting each few-shot example in a prompt with a step-by-step explanation towards the final answer. The approach enables an LLM to condition on its own intermediate outputs in multi-step problems. As noted in Singhal et al. [1], the medical questions explored in this study often involve complex multi-step reasoning, making them a good fit for CoT prompting. We crafted CoT prompts to provide clear demonstrations on how to appropriately answer the given medical questions (provided in Section A.3.1)."

    - **Relevance:** This citation introduces the chain-of-thought prompting strategy and its potential for improving LLM performance on complex medical reasoning tasks.
    - **Claim:** "Self-consistency Self-consistency (SC) is a strategy introduced by Wang et al. [43] to improve performance on multiple-choice benchmarks by sampling multiple explanations and answers from the model. The final answer is the one with the majority (or plurality) vote. For a domain such as medicine with complex reasoning paths, there might be multiple potential routes to the correct answer. Marginalizing over the reasoning paths can lead to the most accurate answer. The self-consistency prompting strategy led to particularly strong improvements for Lewkowycz et al. [44]. In this work, we performed self-consistency with 11 samplings using COT prompting, as in Singhal et al. [1]."

    - **Relevance:** This citation introduces the self-consistency prompting strategy and its potential for improving LLM performance on multiple-choice tasks.
    - **Claim:** "Ensemble refinement Building on chain-of-thought and self-consistency, we developed a simple prompting strategy we refer to as ensemble refinement (ER). ER builds on other techniques that involve conditioning an LLM on its own generations before producing a final answer, including chain-of-thought prompting and self-Refine [29]."

    - **Relevance:** This citation introduces the novel ensemble refinement prompting strategy, which builds upon previous work in prompting techniques.
    - **Claim:** "An increasingly important concern given recent advances in large models pretrained on web-scale data is the potential for overlap between evaluation benchmarks and training data. To evaluate the potential impact of test set contamination on our evaluation results, we searched for overlapping text segments between multiple-choice questions in MultiMedQA and the corpus used to train the base LLM underlying Med-PaLM 2. Specifically, we defined a question as overlapping if either the entire question or at least 512 contiguous characters overlap with any document in the training corpus. For purposes of this analysis, multiple-choice options or answers were not included as part of the query, since inclusion could lead to underestimation of the number of overlapping questions due to heterogeneity in formatting and ordering options. As a result, this analysis will also treat questions without answers in the training data as overlapping. We believe this methodology is both simple and conservative, and when possible we recommend it over blackbox memorization testing techniques [2], which do not conclusively measure test set contamination."

**2.5 Discussion and Related Work:**

- **Key Points:** The section discusses the implications of the paper's findings, highlighting the importance of human evaluation and the need for further research in areas such as multi-turn dialogue and active information acquisition.
- **Citations:**
    - **Claim:** "Our use of adversarial question sets also enables explicit study of LLM performance in difficult cases. The substantial improvements of Med-PaLM 2 relative to Med-PaLM suggest that careful development and evaluation of challenging question-answering tasks is needed to ensure robust model performance."
    - **Citation:** N/A
    - **Relevance:** This statement emphasizes the importance of adversarial testing for pushing the boundaries of LLM capabilities.
    - **Claim:** "Using a multi-dimensional evaluation framework lets us understand tradeoffs in more detail. For instance, Med-PaLM 2 answers significantly improved performance on "missing important content" (Table A.2) and were longer on average (Table A.9) than Med-PaLM or physician answers. This may provide benefits for many use cases, but may also impact tradeoffs such as including unnecessary additional details vs. omitting important information. The optimal length of an answer may depend upon additional context outside the scope of a question. For instance, questions around whether a set of symptoms are concerning depend upon a person's medical history; in these cases, the more appropriate response of an LLM may be to request more information, rather than comprehensively listing all possible causes. Our evaluation did not consider multi-turn dialogue [46], nor did it clearly distinguish performance of Med-PaLM 2 answers from physician-generated answers, motivating more granular evaluation, including pairwise evaluation and adversarial evaluation."

**8. Critical Analysis of Citation Usage:**

- **Effectiveness:** The authors effectively use citations to support their arguments and findings, providing a strong foundation for their claims.
- **Areas for Improvement:**
    - The paper could benefit from additional citations in the discussion section, particularly when discussing the implications of the paper's findings for real-world applications.
    - The paper could also benefit from a more comprehensive analysis of the potential biases in the selection of cited works, particularly in the context of health equity.
- **Potential Biases:** The paper primarily cites works from Google Research, which may reflect a bias towards the authors' own institution.

**9. Final Summary:**

- **Contribution:** The paper makes a significant contribution to the field of medical question answering by introducing Med-PaLM 2, a large language model that demonstrates expert-level performance on a variety of benchmarks and human evaluation tasks.
- **Influential Works:** The paper frequently cites works from Google Research, particularly those related to PaLM and Med-PaLM, highlighting the importance of these models in the development of LLMs for medical applications.
- **Integration of Existing Literature:** The paper effectively integrates existing literature to support its claims and findings, providing a strong foundation for its arguments and demonstrating the significant progress being made in the field of medical question answering.

**Overall Assessment:** The paper provides a compelling demonstration of the progress being made in developing LLMs for medical question answering. The authors effectively use citations to support their arguments and findings, highlighting the importance of their work in pushing the boundaries of LLM capabilities for this domain. However, the paper could benefit from a more comprehensive analysis of potential biases in the selection of cited works and from a more detailed discussion of the implications of the paper's findings for real-world applications.
