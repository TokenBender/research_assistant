**Summary:** This section details the core approach of StructGPT, which is based on an iterative reading-then-reasoning (IRR) framework. It introduces the concept of specialized interfaces for each type of structured data, allowing LLMs to access and filter relevant information efficiently. The IRR procedure involves three steps: invoking an interface, linearizing the extracted information, and generating the answer or SQL query using an LLM. The authors emphasize that this approach allows LLMs to concentrate on reasoning while the interfaces handle the complexities of accessing and manipulating structured data.

### 2.5 Interfaces for Structured Data

**Summary:** This section describes the specialized interfaces designed for each type of structured data: knowledge graphs, tables, and databases. These interfaces provide LLMs with specific functions for accessing and filtering data, such as extracting neighbor relations in KGs, extracting columns and sub-tables from tables, and extracting table and column information from databases.

**Significant Citations:**

* **Claim:** "Due to the standardized data formats, structured data is often equipped with efficient data management ways, e.g., SQL for the database."
    * **Relevance:** This statement justifies the need for specialized interfaces, as structured data often has efficient access mechanisms that LLMs can leverage.
* **Claim:** "In our approach, we aim to provide LLMs with specialized interfaces, helping LLMs to read and utilize the structured data."
    * **Relevance:** This statement reiterates the core goal of the interfaces, which is to facilitate LLM interaction with structured data.


### 2.6 Reading and Reasoning with Interfaces

**Summary:** This section introduces the core iterative reading-then-reasoning (IRR) procedure. It describes how the interfaces are invoked to extract relevant information, how this information is linearized into a textual format that LLMs can understand, and how LLMs are used to generate answers or SQL queries based on the linearized information. The authors also discuss the two types of prompts used to guide LLMs in selecting relevant evidence and generating answers.

**Significant Citations:**

* **Claim:** "Based on the above interfaces, we propose a general invoking-linearization-generation procedure that can be iterated in multiple turns for utilizing LLMs to perform reading and reasoning on structured data."
    * **Relevance:** This statement introduces the core IRR procedure, which is the central contribution of the paper.
* **Claim:** "For each iteration, based on the currently collected data, we first invoke an interface to extract relevant evidence from structure data, then linearize it into a textual prompt, and finally feed the prompt into the LLM for generation (selecting useful data or predicting the answer)."
    * **Relevance:** This statement outlines the three key steps of the IRR procedure, providing a clear understanding of the process.
* **Claim:** "While for contents in columns and rows, we follow existing work (Pasupat and Liang, 2015) that first converts them into triples, where head entities are the row indices, relations are column names, and tail entities are the content in the cell, e.g., “(row 1, year, 1896)" and "(row 1, city, Athens)". Then, for each row, we extract the row indices in the front and omit it in the triples, to compose a simplified sentence, e.g., “row 1: (year, 1896), (city, Athens)". "

    - **Contribution:** These citations provide the theoretical foundation for the tool augmentation approach adopted in StructGPT, emphasizing the benefits of specialized interfaces for enhancing LLM capabilities.
- **Insight:** The proposed Iterative Reading-then-Reasoning (IRR) framework, which combines specialized interfaces with LLMs, effectively enhances the reasoning capabilities of LLMs on KGQA, TableQA, and Text-to-SQL tasks.

    - **Contribution:** These citations highlight the novelty of the IRR framework, contrasting it with existing retrieval-augmented and knowledge-grounded approaches. The IRR framework leverages the strengths of both approaches while addressing their limitations.


## 4. Experimental Methodology and Its Foundations

- **Experimental Setup:** The authors conducted experiments on three complex reasoning tasks over structured data: KGQA, TableQA, and Text-to-SQL. They used a variety of benchmark datasets for each task, including WebQSP, MetaQA, WikiSQL, WikiTableQuestions, TabFact, Spider, Spider-SYN, and Spider-Realistic. They compared the performance of StructGPT with several baselines, including supervised learning models and LLMs used in a zero-shot setting.
- **Foundations in Cited Works:**
    - The authors used the **tool augmentation** paradigm, inspired by works like **WebGPT** (Nakano et al., 2021) and **Toolformer** (Schick et al., 2023), as a foundation for their methodology.
    - The **linearization** techniques used for converting structured data into
