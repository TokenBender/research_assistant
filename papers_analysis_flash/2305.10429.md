### 2.1 Introduction

**Summary:** The introduction highlights the impact of data domain mixtures on language model (LM) performance, emphasizing the challenge of determining optimal domain weights for diverse downstream tasks. Existing methods rely on intuition or tuning weights based on specific downstream tasks, which can be inefficient and lead to overfitting. DoReMi proposes a novel approach to optimize domain weights without prior knowledge of downstream tasks.

## 4. Experimental Methodology and Its Foundations

**Experimental Setup:**

The paper's experiments involve training language models on two datasets: The Pile and GLaM. The core methodology is DoReMi, which consists of three main steps:

1. **Training a small reference model:** A small language model is trained using initial domain weights (e.g., uniform or based on token counts).
2. **Training a proxy model with Group DRO:** A small proxy model is trained using Group DRO to optimize domain weights. The objective is to minimize the worst-case excess loss across domains.
3. **Training a large model with optimized domain weights:** A larger language model is trained using the optimized domain weights obtained from the proxy model.

**Foundations in Cited Works:**

* **Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO):** The core of DoReMi's methodology is based on DRO, particularly the Group DRO optimizer. The authors cite works like Nemirovski et al. (2009) and Sagawa et al. (2020) to establish the theoretical foundation for DRO and its application in deep learning.
* **DRO-LM:** The authors adapt the DRO-LM framework (Oren et al., 2019) to optimize domain weights instead of training a robust model. This adaptation is a novel aspect of the methodology.
* **Transformer Models:** The authors use Transformer decoder-only models (Vaswani et al., 2017) as the base architecture for their language models.


**Novel Aspects of Methodology:**

* **Adapting DRO for Domain Weight Optimization:** The core novelty of DoReMi lies in adapting the DRO framework to optimize domain weights rather than training a robust model. This approach allows for efficient optimization of domain weights without requiring extensive training of numerous models with different weight configurations.
* **Using a Proxy Model for Domain Weight Optimization:** The use of a smaller proxy model to optimize domain weights is a computationally efficient approach compared to directly optimizing weights for the large target model.


## 5. Results in Context

**Main Results:**

* **Improved Perplexity:** DoReMi consistently reduces perplexity across all domains on The Pile, even when downweighting some domains.
* **Improved Downstream Accuracy:** DoReMi improves average downstream accuracy on The Pile by 6.5% and achieves the baseline accuracy 2.6x faster.
* **Comparable Performance on GLaM:** DoReMi achieves comparable performance to downstream-tuned domain weights on the GLaM dataset, demonstrating its ability to generalize across different datasets.
* **Robustness Across Scales:** DoReMi consistently improves performance across different model scales, suggesting its applicability to a wide range of model sizes.


**Comparison with Existing Literature:**

* **GLaM Dataset:** DoReMi's results on the GLaM dataset are compared to the performance of models trained with domain weights tuned on downstream tasks (Du et al., 2021). DoReMi achieves comparable performance, demonstrating its ability to achieve good results without explicit downstream task knowledge.
* **The Pile Dataset:** DoReMi's results on The Pile are compared to a baseline model trained with the default domain weights (Gao et al., 2020). DoReMi significantly improves both perplexity and downstream accuracy, showcasing its effectiveness in optimizing domain weights.
* **DRO-LM:** DoReMi builds upon the DRO-LM framework (Oren et al., 2019) but adapts it for domain weight optimization. The authors highlight the differences between their approach and DRO-LM, emphasizing the novelty of their method.


**Confirmation, Contradiction, or Extension of Cited Works:**

* **Confirmation:** DoReMi's results confirm the general observation that data composition significantly impacts LM performance (Du et al., 2021, Hoffmann et al., 2022).
* **Extension:** DoReMi extends the DRO-LM framework (Oren et al., 2019) by applying it to domain weight optimization, demonstrating a novel application of DRO in the context of LM pretraining.
