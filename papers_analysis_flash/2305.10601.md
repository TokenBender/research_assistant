### 2.1 Introduction

**Summary:** The introduction highlights the increasing capabilities of LLMs across various tasks, despite their reliance on a simple autoregressive mechanism for token-level decision-making. It argues that this mechanism might be insufficient for general problem-solving and draws inspiration from dual-process models of human cognition to propose a more deliberate approach.

**Significant Citations:**

- **Claim:** "Originally designed to generate text, scaled-up versions of language models (LMs) such as GPT [25, 26, 1, 23] and PaLM [5] have been shown to be increasingly capable of performing an ever wider range of tasks requiring mathematical, symbolic, commonsense, and knowledge reasoning."

  - **Relevance:** This citation introduces CoT prompting, a key concept that ToT builds upon and generalizes.

- **Claim:** "Self-consistency with CoT (CoT-SC) [36] is an ensemble approach that samples k i.i.d. chains of thought: [zin, y(i)] ~ pfoT (Z1...n, y|x) (i = 1…k), then returns the most frequent output: arg maxy #{i | y(i) = y}."
