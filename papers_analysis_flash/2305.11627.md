### 2.3 Methods

**Summary:** This section details the LLM-Pruner method, which consists of three stages: discovery, estimation, and recovery. It explains the dependency-based structural pruning approach and how it identifies and groups interdependent structures within the LLM.

**Significant Citations:**

* **Claim:** "Following the conventional model compression pipeline[22], LLM-Pruner consists of three steps: (1) Discovery Stage (Section 3.1). This step focuses on identifying groups of interdependent structures within LLMs. (2) Estimation Stage (Section 3.2). Once the coupled structures are grouped, the second step entails estimating the contribution of each group to the overall performance of the model and deciding which group to be pruned. (3) Recover Stage (Section 3.3). This step involves fast post-training that alleviates potential performance degradation caused by the removal of structures."
