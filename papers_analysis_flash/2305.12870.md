## 4. Experimental Methodology and Its Foundations

The paper employs an adversarial knowledge distillation framework, which iteratively refines the student model's performance. The framework consists of three stages:

1. **Imitation:** The student model learns to mimic the teacher model's responses to a set of instructions.
2. **Discrimination:** The teacher and student models' responses are compared by a "referee" (also the teacher model) to identify challenging instructions ("hard" examples).
3. **Generation:** The teacher model generates new instructions based on the "hard" examples identified in the previous stage, creating a feedback loop that continuously challenges the student model.

**Foundations:**

* The methodology is inspired by adversarial knowledge distillation (AKD) techniques (Fang et al., 2019; Micaelli and Storkey, 2019a; Heo et al., 2019).
* The use of prompts to elicit different roles from the teacher LLM (referee and generator) is based on the versatile role adaptability of LLMs (Sanh et al., 2022).
* The generation of new instructions is inspired by Xu et al. (2023).

**Novel Aspects:**

* The introduction of "feedback" in the form of identifying and generating challenging instructions is a novel aspect of the methodology.
* The use of a black-box teacher model without access to its internal parameters or gradients is a novel approach to knowledge distillation.
