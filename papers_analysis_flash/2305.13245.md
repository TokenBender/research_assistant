## 2. Section-by-Section Analysis with Citation Extraction

### 2.1 Introduction

- **Key Points:** The introduction highlights the bottleneck of autoregressive decoder inference in Transformer models due to memory bandwidth overhead from loading attention keys and values. It introduces multi-query attention (MQA) as a solution for reducing this overhead but acknowledges its potential drawbacks, including quality degradation and training instability. The authors then present their two main contributions: a recipe for uptraining multi-head checkpoints to use MQA and the introduction of GQA.

## 4. Experimental Methodology and Its Foundations

- **Experimental Setup:** The experiments are conducted using the T5.1.1 architecture, implemented with JAX, Flax, and Flaxformer. The authors use T5 Large and XXL models with multi-head attention as baselines and uptrain them to use MQA and GQA. They evaluate the models on various summarization, translation, and question-answering datasets.
- **Foundations:** The experimental methodology is based on the T5 architecture (Raffel et al., 2020) and utilizes tools like JAX (Bradbury et al., 2018), Flax (Heek et al., 2020), and Flaxformer.
- **Novel Aspects:** The novel aspects of the methodology include the uptraining process for converting multi-head checkpoints to multi-query models and the introduction of GQA.
- **Justification for Novel Approaches:** The authors cite (Komatsuzaki et al., 2022) to justify the uptraining approach, drawing inspiration from the work on sparsely activated Mixture-of-Experts models. The introduction of GQA is justified by the need for a trade-off between speed and quality, which is supported by the existing literature on memory bandwidth limitations in Transformer models (Shazeer, 2019; Pope et al., 2022).


## 5. Results in Context
