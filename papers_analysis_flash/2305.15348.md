## 4. Experimental Methodology and Its Foundations

**Experimental Setup:** The authors evaluate READ on the GLUE benchmark using the T5 transformer model as the backbone. They compare READ's performance to full fine-tuning and other PETL methods, including adapters, LoRA, and prompt tuning. They measure energy consumption and peak memory usage during training.

**Foundations:**

* **PETL Methods:** The authors draw inspiration from existing PETL methods like adapters [Houlsby et al., 2019], LoRA [Hu et al., 2021], and prompt tuning [Lester et al., 2021]. They use these methods as baselines for comparison.
* **Side-Tuning:** The concept of side networks, as explored in Side-Tuning [Zhang et al., 2020] and LST [Sung et al., 2022], is a key foundation for READ's design. READ builds upon these approaches by introducing a recurrent network instead of a transformer-based side network.
* **Memory-Efficient Training:** The authors acknowledge the importance of memory-efficient training techniques like gradient checkpointing [Chen et al., 2016] and ZeRO [Rajbhandari et al., 2020]. While they don't explicitly implement these techniques in READ, they highlight their relevance to the broader context of training large models.


**Novel Aspects:**

* **Recurrent Network for Side-Tuning:** The use of a recurrent neural network (RNN) as the side network is a novel aspect of READ. The authors justify this choice by highlighting the RNN's ability to process sequential information and its scalability with respect to the backbone model size.
* **Theoretical Justification:** The authors provide a theoretical justification for READ's approach by deriving an inductive formula for the corrections learned by the RNN. This theoretical foundation is a novel contribution that helps explain why READ is effective.


## 5. Results in Context

**Main Results:**

* READ achieves competitive performance on the GLUE benchmark compared to full fine-tuning and other PETL methods.
* READ reduces training energy consumption by up to 90% and memory usage by 56% compared to full fine-tuning.
* READ's parameter count scales sub-linearly with the size of the backbone model, making it a scalable solution for fine-tuning large transformers.
* READ achieves comparable inference latency and memory efficiency to other PETL methods.


**Comparison with Existing Literature:**

* **Confirmation:** READ's results confirm the benefits of PETL methods in reducing the number of trainable parameters. However, READ goes further by demonstrating significant reductions in energy consumption and memory usage, which is not typically achieved by other PETL methods.
* **Extension:** READ extends the work on side-tuning methods by introducing a recurrent network instead of a transformer-based side network. This extension leads to improved scalability and efficiency.
* **Contradiction:** READ's results contradict the notion that PETL methods are inherently memory-efficient. While they reduce the number of trainable parameters, they often still require significant computational resources for fine-tuning. READ addresses this limitation by significantly reducing memory usage.
