### 2.3 Method: Data-Constrained Scaling Laws

This section introduces the paper's novel methodology for scaling LLMs in data-constrained regimes. The authors propose a modified version of the Chinchilla scaling law [42] that accounts for data constraints and fits the terms in the modified scaling law to data from a large body of experiments. The key innovation is the introduction of a new term, RD, which represents the number of repetitions of the unique data. The authors then derive a parametric fit for the loss function that incorporates this new term.

### 2.5 Results: Resource Allocation for Data-Constrained Scaling

This section presents the main results of the paper, focusing on the optimal allocation of compute resources in data-constrained settings. The authors find that training models for multiple epochs on repeated data can significantly improve performance compared to training a larger model for a single epoch on unique data. They also find that the value of repeated data decays predictably with increasing epochs, and that allocating new compute to both more parameters and epochs is necessary.

## 5. Results in Context

The paper's main results demonstrate that training LLMs for multiple epochs on repeated data can significantly improve performance compared to training a larger model for a single epoch on unique data. The authors also find that the value of repeated data decays predictably with increasing epochs, and that allocating new compute to both more parameters and epochs is necessary for optimal performance in data-constrained settings.

**Key Results:**

* Models trained for multiple epochs on repeated data consistently outperform models trained for a single epoch on unique data, even when the total compute budget is the same.
* The value of repeated data decays predictably with increasing epochs, and allocating new compute to both more parameters and epochs is necessary for optimal performance in data-constrained settings.
* Code augmentation can provide a 2x increase in effective tokens, even when evaluating only natural language tasks.
* Perplexity filtering can be effective for noisy datasets, but deduplication does not provide significant benefits.

**Comparison with Existing Literature:**

* The paper's findings on the value of repeated data confirm the results of Hernandez et al. (2022), who found that repeating only 0.1% of training data 100 times significantly degrades performance. However, the paper's findings extend this work by demonstrating that repeating the entire training corpus for multiple epochs can be beneficial, especially when data is limited.
* The paper's findings on the optimal allocation of compute resources in data-constrained settings contradict the results of Hoffmann et al. (2022), who suggest that parameters and data should be scaled equally. The paper's findings suggest that epochs should be scaled slightly faster than parameters in data-constrained settings.
