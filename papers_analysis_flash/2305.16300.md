### 2.3 Methodology

**Summary:** This section details the proposed "landmark attention" method. It explains how the input is divided into blocks, and a special "landmark token" is introduced at the end of each block. The authors describe the training process, where the landmark token's key vector becomes the representative vector of the block. They introduce the "Grouped Softmax" function to modify the attention mechanism, allowing the model to attend to relevant blocks based on the attention score to the landmark tokens. The inference process is also explained, where the model retrieves relevant blocks from a cache based on landmark token scores and integrates them with the standard attention mechanism.
