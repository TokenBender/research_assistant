## 4. Experimental Methodology and Its Foundations

**Experimental Setup:** The authors use the benchmark dataset and tasks from Delétang et al. (2023), focusing on algorithmic reasoning problems derived from formal language theory. They employ a standard Transformer encoder-only architecture with various positional encoding schemes, including the proposed randomized approach. The models are trained on sequences of varying lengths up to a maximum length N and evaluated on sequences of lengths greater than N.

**Foundations:**

* **Delétang et al. (2023):** The authors explicitly build upon the work of Delétang et al. (2023) by using their benchmark dataset and tasks. This provides a strong foundation for comparing the proposed method to existing approaches.

* **Dai et al. (2019):** The concept of relative positional encodings, which the authors adapt and extend, originates from the work of Dai et al. (2019).

**Novel Aspects:**

* The core novelty lies in the **randomized positional encoding scheme**. The authors introduce the idea of randomly selecting a subset of positions from a larger range and using them to encode the input sequence.
* The authors justify this novel approach by arguing that it decouples the positional encoding from the maximum training sequence length, allowing for better generalization to longer sequences.
