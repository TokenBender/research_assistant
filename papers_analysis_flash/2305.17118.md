### 2.3 The Persistence of Importance Hypothesis

**Summary:** This section introduces the core hypothesis of the paper: the "Persistence of Importance." It begins by presenting the observation of repetitive attention patterns in LLMs, where certain tokens consistently receive high attention scores across different positions in a sequence.
