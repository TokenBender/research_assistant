## 4. Experimental Methodology and Its Foundations

- **Experimental Setup:** The authors conduct experiments on LLaMA models of sizes 7B, 13B, and 30B, using various datasets for evaluation, including Common Sense Reasoning tasks, TriviaQA, MMLU, WikiText2, and C4. They employ AdamW optimizer with cosine learning rate decay, a batch size of 1 per GPU, and a learning rate of 2e-5. The knowledge distillation is performed using cross-entropy loss with soft labels generated from the pre-trained teacher model.

- **Foundations in Cited Works:**

    - The authors use the AdamW optimizer (Loshchilov & Hutter, 2017) for training, which is a widely used optimization algorithm in deep learning.
    - The knowledge distillation technique is based on the general concept of knowledge distillation (Hinton et al., 2015), but adapted for the specific context of LLM quantization.
    - The experimental setup for evaluating the performance of quantized LLMs on various tasks is based on the standard benchmarks and datasets used in the LLM community (e.g., BoolQ, PIQA, TriviaQA, MMLU, WikiText2, C4).


- **Novel Aspects of Methodology:**

    - **Data-Free Distillation:** The authors introduce a novel data-free distillation method for QAT, which leverages next-token generation from the pre-trained model to generate training data. This approach is justified by the difficulty of obtaining and pre-processing large LLM training datasets.
    - **KV Cache Quantization during QAT:** The authors propose quantizing the KV cache during QAT, which is a novel approach compared to existing methods that primarily focus on post-training quantization.

    - The results confirm the findings of previous work on the effectiveness of 8-bit quantization for LLMs (Xiao et al., 2022; Yao et al., 2022).
    - The results contradict the common practice of clipping outliers in quantization methods for smaller models, demonstrating that it's detrimental for LLMs.
    - The results extend the existing literature on LLM quantization by demonstrating the feasibility and effectiveness of QAT for LLMs at very low bit-widths (4-bits), particularly for the KV cache.
