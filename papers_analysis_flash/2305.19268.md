## Intriguing Properties of Quantization at Scale: A Comprehensive Analysis

This analysis focuses on the paper "Intriguing Properties of Quantization at Scale" by Arash Ahmadian et al., published as a preprint on May 30, 2023, on arXiv. The paper investigates the impact of various optimization choices during pre-training on the sensitivity of large language models (LLMs) to post-training quantization (PTQ). It cites a total of 68 references to support its claims and findings.
