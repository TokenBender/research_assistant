- **Novel Aspects:** The use of a large-scale PRM to supervise smaller models is a novel aspect of the methodology, allowing for more controlled comparisons and ablations. The authors don't explicitly cite any work to justify this specific approach, but it builds upon the general idea of using reward models for supervision, as seen in Gao et al. (2022).
- **Justification for Novel Approaches:** While not explicitly citing a specific work for the large-scale PRM supervision approach, the authors justify it by highlighting the high cost of human feedback and the need for more efficient data collection methods.
