The authors emphasize that AWQ does not rely on backpropagation or reconstruction, leading to better generalization across domains and modalities.

  - **Relevance:** This claim introduces the core concept of AWQ, which is to identify and protect a small subset of important weights during quantization.
- **Claim:** "To find the salient weight channels, the insight is that we should refer to the activation distribution instead of the weight distribution, despite we are doing weight-only quantization: weight channels corresponding to larger activation magnitudes are more salient since they process more important features."
  - **Citation:** (None explicitly provided, but the claim is based on the authors' own analysis and intuition.)
  - **Relevance:** This claim explains the novel aspect of AWQ, which is its activation-awareness. It justifies why activation statistics are more informative than weight magnitudes for identifying salient weights.
