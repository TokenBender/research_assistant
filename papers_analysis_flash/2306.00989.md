### 2.1 Introduction

**Summary:** The introduction establishes the dominance of Vision Transformers (ViTs) in computer vision tasks due to their accuracy and scalability. It highlights the inefficiency of ViTs in utilizing parameters due to uniform spatial resolution and channel counts. The authors then introduce the concept of hierarchical models, which use fewer channels and higher spatial resolution in early stages and contrast this with the approach of modern hierarchical ViTs that add complexity in pursuit of supervised classification performance. They argue that this complexity is unnecessary and that MAE pretraining can effectively teach ViTs spatial reasoning, making specialized modules redundant.

## 8. Critical Analysis of Citation Usage

**Effectiveness of Citation Usage:**

The authors generally use citations effectively to support their claims and findings. They provide a clear context for their work by referencing key papers in the field of Vision Transformers, hierarchical models, and MAE pretraining. The citations are relevant and help readers understand the broader research context.

**Areas for Improvement:**

- **Diversity of Cited Works:** While the authors cite a wide range of papers, there could be a greater emphasis on citing works from diverse research groups and publications. This would help to ensure a more balanced and comprehensive representation of the field.
- **Discussion of Limitations:** The authors could have provided a more in-depth discussion of the limitations of their approach, such as the potential impact of the simplified architecture on certain downstream tasks. Citing relevant works that discuss the limitations of MAE or hierarchical ViTs could have strengthened this aspect of the discussion.

**Potential Biases:**

- **Focus on MAE:** The authors heavily rely on MAE pretraining, which might lead to a bias towards this specific method. While MAE is a powerful technique, exploring other self-supervised methods could have provided a more comprehensive evaluation of Hiera's potential.
- **Meta AI/FAIR Dominance:** A significant portion of the cited works are from Meta AI/FAIR researchers. While this is understandable given the authors' affiliation, a more diverse set of cited works from other research groups would have strengthened the paper's objectivity.


## 9. Final Summary

**Contribution to the Field:**

The paper makes a significant contribution to the field of deep learning and computer vision by demonstrating that the added complexity in modern hierarchical ViTs is unnecessary. The authors introduce Hiera, a simplified hierarchical ViT that achieves state-of-the-art performance on video recognition tasks and strong performance on image recognition tasks through MAE pretraining. This work highlights the importance of simplicity and efficiency in deep learning model design.
