### 3 Fine-Tuning Based on Reinforcement Learning

- **Summary:** This section delves into the core of the paper, focusing on the RLHF stage of language model fine-tuning. It introduces the general policy gradient algorithm and then discusses the challenges of KL-regularized optimization in policy improvement. The authors introduce the concept of maximizing regularized advantages and present the KL-regularized optimization problem as a target for policy improvement.
- **Significant Citations:**

    a. **Claim:** "The optimization (2) is usually broken down into multiple iterations. In each iteration, we maximize F(0; s, πold), where πold is the policy that the agent arrives at in the previous iteration. This technique, referred to as Conservative Policy Iteration (CPI), was first presented in Kakade and Langford (2002)."

### 3.1 Proximal Policy Optimization

- **Summary:** This section describes the PPO algorithm, emphasizing its use of importance sampling and KL-penalized reward to estimate advantages. It also highlights the use of clipping to address issues with ill-conditioned gradients.
- **Significant Citations:**

    a. **Claim:** "PPO also involves the following innovation: Instead of penalizing the expected advantage with the estimated KL-divergence as in (2), PPO directly subtracts the KL penalty term from the reward received by the agent. And one may also adaptively adjust the penalty weight λ based on the deviation of πθ from πinit (Schulman et al., 2017; Dhariwal et al., 2017; Ziegler et al., 2019)."

- **Significant Citations:**

    a. **Claim:** "To facilitate online update, AWR makes three changes from Equation (4): ... The KL-divergence in (4) only accounts for one state s. AWR minimizes a distribution of states dold."
