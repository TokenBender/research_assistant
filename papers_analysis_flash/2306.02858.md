The use of ImageBind as a pre-trained audio encoder is a novel approach to address the scarcity of audio-text data.
- **Justification for Novel Approaches:** The authors justify the need for a model that handles both visual and auditory information by highlighting the limitations of existing models that focus on only one additional modality. The use of ImageBind is justified by the scarcity of audio-text data and its ability to align different modalities.
