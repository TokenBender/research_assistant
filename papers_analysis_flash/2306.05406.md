**2.1 Introduction**

* **Key Points:** The introduction highlights the challenge of adapting PLMs to specific domains, emphasizing the cost and computational burden of fine-tuning or continued pre-training. It introduces the concept of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like prompt-based and adapter-based tuning as potential solutions. However, it also points out the limitations of these methods, particularly the issue of catastrophic forgetting. The authors then introduce their proposed solution, MixDA, which aims to decouple and inject domain knowledge into PLMs' memories.

**4. Experimental Methodology and Its Foundations**

* **Experimental Setup:** The paper employs a two-stage training process for MixDA. 
    * **Stage 1:** Domain-specific adapters are trained on both domain-specific and pre-training corpora, with the goal of injecting domain knowledge into the model while preserving the original knowledge.
    * **Stage 2:** A mixture-of-adapters gate and task-specific adapters are trained on downstream tasks, allowing the model to dynamically select the relevant domain knowledge for each task.
* **Foundations:**
    * The authors draw inspiration from recent studies that suggest knowledge is stored in the FFNs of Transformer layers (Geva et al., 2021; Cao et al., 2021; Meng et al., 2022).
    * They leverage the concept of adapter modules, which have been shown to be effective for parameter-efficient fine-tuning (Houlsby et al., 2019; Pfeiffer et al., 2020b).
    * The two-stage training strategy is inspired by the need to address catastrophic forgetting in domain adaptation (Yogatama et al., 2019; Gururangan et al., 2020).
* **Novel Aspects:**
    * The decoupling of FFNs into domain-specific and original pre-trained components is a novel approach for injecting domain knowledge.
    * The mixture-of-adapters gate, which dynamically routes information through different adapters, is a novel mechanism for controlling the flow of domain knowledge.
    * The authors justify these novel approaches by citing the aforementioned works on knowledge storage in FFNs, the effectiveness of adapters, and the challenges of catastrophic forgetting.
