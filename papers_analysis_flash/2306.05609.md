## 2. Section-by-Section Analysis with Citation Extraction

### 2.1 Introduction

This section introduces the concept of word sense extension, highlighting the creative reuse of words by humans to express novel meanings. It contrasts this with the traditional focus of WSD on disambiguating existing senses.

* **Claim:** "Humans make creative reuse of words to express novel senses. For example, the English verb arrive extended from its original sense “to come to locations (e.g., to arrive at the gate)” toward new senses such as "to come to an event (e.g., to arrive at a concert)” and “to achieve a goal or cognitive state (e.g., to arrive at a conclusion)" (see Figure 1)."
    * **Citation:**  (None explicitly provided, but illustrated in Figure 1)
    * **Relevance:** This example sets the stage for the problem of WSE, demonstrating how words can acquire new meanings in context.

* **Claim:** "The extension of word meaning toward new context may draw on different cognitive processes such as metonymy and metaphor, and here we develop a general framework that infers how words extend to plausible new senses."
    * **Citation:** (None explicitly provided, but sets the stage for the paper's contribution)
    * **Relevance:** This statement introduces the core idea of the paper – developing a framework that models how words extend to new senses based on cognitive processes.


### 2.2 Related Work: Models of Word Meaning Extension

This section reviews existing research on models of word meaning extension, focusing on generative lexicon theory, cognitive linguistics, and the role of cognitive devices like metonymy and metaphor.

* **Claim:** "The Generative Lexicon theory by Pustejovsky (1998) argues that a fixed set of generative devices, such as type-coercion and co-composition, can operate on the lexical structure a word to produce various related meaning interpretations."
    * **Citation:** Pustejovsky, 1998. The generative lexicon. MIT press.
    * **Relevance:** This citation introduces a prominent theory in lexical semantics that provides a foundation for understanding how words can generate new meanings.

## 4. Experimental Methodology and Its Foundations

The paper uses a transformer-based language model (BERT) as the core component of its WSE framework. The methodology involves:

1. **Word Type Partitioning:** Dividing polysemous words into pseudo-tokens representing source and target senses.
2. **Chaining-Based Inference:** Using a chaining mechanism to predict the likelihood of a source sense extending to a target sense based on semantic similarity.
3. **Sense-Extensional Semantic Space Learning:** Training the language model to learn a transformed semantic space that captures the regularities of sense extension.

* **Foundations:** The authors draw upon the BERT architecture (Devlin et al., 2019) as the foundation for their language model. They also leverage the cognitive theory of chaining (Lakoff, 1987; Habibi et al., 2020) as a theoretical basis for their chaining-based inference mechanism.
* **Novel Aspects:** The core novelty lies in the WSE framework itself, including the word type partitioning, chaining-based inference, and the learning of a sense-extensional semantic space. The authors cite related work in lexical substitution (McCarthy and Navigli, 2007; Melamud et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2019) to highlight the broader context of their work, but they emphasize the novel aspect of extending the sense inventory of a word rather than simply substituting it.


## 5. Results in Context

The main results of the paper are:

* **WSE models outperform baseline models in predicting plausible novel word senses.** The chaining-based WSE models, particularly the exemplar-based model, achieve higher mean precision and MRR scores compared to BERT-based baselines (BERT-STS and BERT-MLM) and a random baseline.
* **WSE improves the performance of WSD models, especially for rare word senses.** Integrating WSE into BERT-based WSD models leads to significant improvements in F1-score, particularly for few-shot and zero-shot scenarios.
* **WSE models exhibit human-like sensitivity to semantic relatedness.** The performance of the WSE models is better when the target sense is conceptually similar to the existing source senses.

* **Comparison with Existing Literature:** The authors compare their results with existing WSD models (Raganato et al., 2017; Blevins and Zettlemoyer, 2020) and demonstrate that their WSE framework leads to improvements, particularly for rare word senses.
* **Confirmation/Contradiction/Extension:** The results confirm the hypothesis that chaining-based models can effectively capture the regularities of sense extension. They also extend the existing literature on WSD by demonstrating the benefits of incorporating WSE for handling rare word senses.


## 6. Discussion and Related Work
