**Experimental Setup:** The paper evaluates LRFormer on standard OOD benchmarks like CIFAR-10/100 vs. SVHN and CIFAR-10/100 vs. CIFAR-100/10. It compares LRFormer with deterministic models, MC Dropout, deep ensembles, MCD-GP, DUQ, DUE, and SNGP. The evaluation metrics include accuracy, ECE, NLL, AUROC, and AUPR. The training process utilizes AdamW optimizer, cosine learning rate scheduler, and a specific patch size for the input images.

**Foundations in Cited Works:**

* **Training Methodology:** The authors adopt the A3 training procedure from Wightman et al. (2021) and Touvron et al. (2022), which is a standard practice for training vision transformers.
