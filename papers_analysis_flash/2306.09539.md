**Effectiveness of Citation Usage:**

The authors generally use citations effectively to support their claims and situate their work within the broader research context. They provide relevant citations to establish the importance of Transformers and SSMs, highlight related work, and justify their methodological choices.

**Areas for Improvement:**

* **More Context for SSM Variants:** While the authors discuss the trade-offs between redundancy and retrievability in the context state construction, they could have provided more citations to support the specific design choices for each variant (Single-Head, Multi-Head, Multi-Filter).
* **Broader Discussion of Hybrid Models:** The discussion of hybrid models could be expanded to include a broader range of approaches, including those that combine Transformers with other types of recurrent networks or memory mechanisms.
* **Discussion of Limitations of Baselines:** The authors could have provided a more in-depth discussion of the limitations of the baselines they compare against, particularly in terms of their ability to handle long sequences.

**Potential Biases:**

The authors primarily cite works from the deep learning community, particularly those related to Transformers and SSMs. There is a slight bias towards recent work, with a focus on papers published in the last few years. However, this is understandable given the rapid pace of innovation in this field.


## 9. Final Summary

**Contribution to the Field:**

The paper makes a significant contribution to the field of deep learning by introducing the Block-State Transformer (BST) layer, a novel hybrid architecture that combines the strengths of Transformers and State Space Models. The BST layer achieves improved performance and efficiency for language modeling, particularly for long sequences.
