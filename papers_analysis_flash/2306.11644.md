- **Key Points:** This section details the authors' approach to creating a high-quality dataset for training their model. They argue that existing datasets like The Stack [KLA+22] and CodeContest [LCC+22] are not ideal for teaching coding fundamentals due to their lack of clarity, structure, and balance.

    a. **Claim:** "As alluded to in the title of the paper, the central ingredient our model relies on textbook-quality training data. Unlike previous work that used standard sources of text data for code generation, such as The Stack [KLA+22] (which contains sourcecode from repositories with permissive licenses) and other web-based datasets (e.g., StackOverflow and CodeContest [LCC+22]), we argue that these sources are not optimal for teaching the model how to reason and plan algorithmically."
