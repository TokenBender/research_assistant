**2. Section-by-Section Analysis with Citation Extraction:**

**a. Introduction:**

- **Key Points:**
    - LLMs are expensive to deploy, especially for long-content generation tasks.
    - The KV cache, storing transient state information, scales linearly with sequence length and batch size, posing a significant memory bottleneck.
    - The authors observe that a small portion of tokens, termed "Heavy Hitters" (H2), contribute disproportionately to attention scores.
    - They propose Heavy Hitter Oracle (H2O), a KV cache eviction policy that dynamically retains a balance of recent and H2 tokens.
    - H2O is formulated as a dynamic submodular problem, and the authors provide theoretical guarantees for their eviction algorithm.
    - Experimental results show H2O significantly improves throughput and reduces latency compared to existing inference systems.
- **Significant Citations:**
    - **[1, 2, 3, 4]:** These citations establish the context of LLMs' impressive capabilities in various natural language processing tasks, highlighting their growing importance in diverse applications.

    - **[6]:** This citation introduces Belady's Algorithm, a classic optimal eviction policy for standard caches, but notes its inapplicability to the dynamic nature of KV cache in LLMs.

**b. Related Work and Problem Setting:**

- **Key Points:**
    - The authors discuss existing approaches for efficient LLM inference, including model compression techniques like pruning [20, 21, 22], quantization [23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28], and conditional computation [29, 30].
    - They highlight the limitations of these methods in addressing the KV cache bottleneck.
    - The authors review prior work on sparse attention approximation [7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 5] and caching [33, 34], emphasizing the challenges of achieving both low miss rates and low-cost eviction policies.
    - They introduce the two-phase breakdown of LLM inference (prompt and token generation) and emphasize the focus of their work on optimizing the KV cache during token generation.

**c. Problem Formulation:**

- **Key Points:**
    - The authors formally define the generative process of LLMs with limited KV cache size, using mathematical notation to represent attention query matrix (Q), key matrix (K), and eviction policy (g).
    - They introduce the concept of "Eviction Policy" (g) as a function that maps the source set (Si-1) to the target set (Si), ensuring the KV cache size remains constant (|Si| = k) and the eviction of at most one KV per step (|Si\Si-1| ≤ 1).
    - The authors emphasize the goal of finding an eviction policy that maintains the output of the generative process similar to the original one without limiting the cache size.
- **Significant Citations:**
    - **[37]:** This citation introduces Belady's Algorithm, a classic optimal eviction policy for standard caches, but notes its inapplicability to the dynamic nature of KV cache in LLMs.

**d. Observations:**

- **Key Points:**
    - The authors present two key empirical insights of LLMs that inspire the design of H2O:
        - **Sparsity:** Attention matrices in LLMs are highly sparse, suggesting that access to all previous key and value embeddings is unnecessary for generating the next token.
        - **Heavy Hitters (H2):** Accumulated attention scores follow a power-law distribution, indicating the existence of a small set of influential tokens (H2) that are critical for accurate generation.
    - They demonstrate that removing H2 completely damages the model's functionality, highlighting their importance.
    - The authors argue that H2 can significantly lower the cache miss rate of existing eviction policies.
    - They theoretically justify the use of H2 as a greedy algorithm, suggesting its near-optimality under the assumption of submodularity in the attention scheme.
- **Significant Citations:**
    - **[35, 36]:** These citations provide evidence of attention sparsity in pre-trained LLMs, supporting the authors' observation of sparsity.
    - **[38]:** This citation introduces the concept of submodularity in the context of neural text generation, providing a theoretical foundation for the authors' analysis of H2.

**e. Heavy-Hitter Oracle:**

- **Key Points:**
    - The authors propose Heavy Hitter Oracle (H2O), a framework that exploits the properties of LLMs and uses simple, low-cost eviction policies to maintain generation quality.
    - H2O dynamically retains a balance of recent and H2 tokens, leveraging the observation that H2 exhibit a strong correlation with frequently co-occurring words in textual data.
    - The authors formulate the eviction policy with greedy H2 as a variant of dynamic submodular maximization, providing theoretical guarantees for its near-optimality.
- **Significant Citations:**
    - **[37]:** This citation introduces Belady's Algorithm, a classic optimal eviction policy for standard caches, but notes its inapplicability to the dynamic nature of KV cache in LLMs.

    - The authors conduct extensive experiments on OPT, LLaMA, and GPT-NeoX across a range of tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of H2O in reducing memory footprint, improving throughput, and maintaining generation quality.
    - H2O achieves comparable performance to the full KV cache model with only 20% KV cache budget, representing a 5x memory reduction.
    - H2O significantly enhances the performance of existing KV cache sparsification techniques like Sparse Transformer.
    - H2O improves throughput by up to 29x compared to DeepSpeed Zero-Inference, Hugging Face Accelerate, and FlexGen, and reduces latency by up to 1.9x.
