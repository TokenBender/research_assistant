**Summary:** This section discusses the limitations of directly extrapolating RoPE beyond its trained context window. It explains how this extrapolation can lead to catastrophic attention scores and unstable model behavior.

**Significant Citations:**

1. **Claim:** "What is the reason behind? How could this happen if the attention score am-n decays as the relative distance |m - n| increases, according to Section 3.4.3 of (Su et al., 2021), and content from very far distances should not matter that much?"

### 2.4 Proposed Approach: Position Interpolation (PI)

**Summary:** This section introduces the core contribution of the paper: Position Interpolation. It explains how, instead of extrapolating, the input position indices are linearly downscaled to match the original context window size. This approach ensures that the attention scores remain within a stable range.
