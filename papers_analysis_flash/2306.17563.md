### 2.2 Difficulties of Ranking Tasks for LLMs

**Summary:** This section delves into the reasons why LLMs struggle with existing text ranking methods, particularly pointwise and listwise approaches. It discusses the challenges of calibration in pointwise methods and the frequent prediction failures in listwise methods, highlighting that LLMs may not fully grasp the ranking task due to a lack of ranking awareness during pre-training.

**Significant Citations:**

* **Claim:** "Pointwise approaches are the major methods prior to very recent listwise approaches discussed in Section 2.2. There are two popular methods, relevance generation (Liang et al., 2022) and query generation (Sachan et al., 2022; Drozdov et al., 2023)."

### 2.3 Pairwise Ranking Prompting

**Summary:** This section introduces the core contribution of the paper: Pairwise Ranking Prompting (PRP). It describes the basic PRP prompt design, its compatibility with both generation and scoring LLMs, and proposes several variants of PRP with different ranking strategies and efficiency properties.

**Significant Citations:**

* **Claim:** "Since it is known that LLMs can be sensitive to text orders in the prompt (Lu et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2023a), for each pair of documents, we will inquire the LLM twice by swapping their order: u(q, d1, d2) and u(q, d2, d₁)."

    * **Relevance:** This citation acknowledges the sensitivity of LLMs to input order, which is a common issue in prompting-based approaches. The authors address this by using a simple debiasing technique of swapping the order of document pairs in the prompt.


* **Claim:** "We note that "pairwise" paradigm is in itself a very general and classic idea that impacted a wide range of areas. The novelty of our work lies in the important scenario where the technique is introduced, the adaptations to make it practical, the effectiveness it enables, as well as potential changes and insights it inspires."
    * **Citation:** (No specific citation is provided for this general claim)
    * **Relevance:** This statement emphasizes the novelty of applying the pairwise comparison paradigm to the specific problem of text ranking with LLMs, highlighting the unique contributions of the paper.


### 2.4 PRP Variants

**Summary:** This section details the three main variants of PRP: PRP-Allpair, PRP-Sorting, and PRP-Sliding-K. It explains the logic behind each variant and discusses their computational complexity and properties.

**Significant Citations:**

* **Claim:** "Intuitively, if the LLM consistently prefers di over another document dj, di gets one point. When LLM is not sure by producing conflicting or irrelevant results (for the generation API), each document gets half a point. There might be ties for the aggregated scores, in which case we fall back to initial ranking."
    * **Citation:** (No specific citation is provided for this intuitive explanation)
    * **Relevance:** This explanation clarifies the core logic of PRP-Allpair, where the LLM's pairwise preferences are aggregated to generate a score for each document.


* **Claim:** "PRP-Allpair favors simple implementation (all LLM API calls can be executed in parallel), and is highly insensitive to input ordering. It essentially ranks documents with win ratio, which has strong theoretical guarantees (Shah and Wainwright, 2018)."
    * **Citation:** Shah, N. B., & Wainwright, M. J. (2018). Simple, robust and optimal ranking from pairwise comparisons. *Journal of Machine Learning Research*, *18*(199), 1-38.
    * **Relevance:** This citation provides theoretical support for the PRP-Allpair approach, highlighting its robustness to input order and its connection to the well-established field of ranking from pairwise comparisons.


* **Claim:** "We note that efficient sorting algorithms, such as Quicksort and Heapsort, depend on pairwise comparisons. We can use the pairwise preferences from LLMs as the comparator for sorting algorithms. We use Heapsort in this paper due to its guaranteed O(N log N) computation complexity."
    * **Citation:** (No specific citation is provided for the general concept of sorting algorithms)
    * **Relevance:** This explanation justifies the use of PRP-Sorting, which leverages the efficiency of sorting algorithms by using LLM outputs as pairwise comparisons.


* **Claim:** "We introduce a sliding window approach that is able to further bring down the computation complexity. One sliding window pass is similar to one pass in the Bubble Sort algorithm: Given an initial ranking, we start from the bottom of the list, compare and swap document pairs with a stride of 1 on-the-fly based on LLM outputs."
    * **Citation:** (No specific citation is provided for the general concept of sliding window algorithms)
    * **Relevance:** This explanation introduces PRP-Sliding-K, which utilizes a sliding window approach to further reduce computational complexity, particularly when only the top-K ranked documents are of interest.

## 4. Experimental Methodology and Its Foundations

**Experimental Setup:**

The paper evaluates the proposed PRP approach on two widely used benchmarks: TREC-DL (2019 & 2020) and BEIR. For each benchmark, the authors:

1. Retrieve the top 100 documents for each query using BM25.
2. Rerank these documents using various PRP variants and baseline methods.
3. Evaluate the performance using NDCG@1, NDCG@5, and NDCG@10.

The authors compare PRP variants with several supervised and unsupervised baselines, including BERT-based and T5-based rankers, as well as other LLM-based approaches like RankGPT and UPR.

**Foundations in Cited Works:**

* The use of BM25 for initial retrieval is a standard practice in information retrieval, as evidenced by its frequent use in the literature (e.g., Lin et al., 2021).
* The choice of NDCG as an evaluation metric is also standard in information retrieval research (e.g., Liu, 2009).
* The use of TREC and BEIR datasets is common for benchmarking information retrieval models (e.g., Thakur et al., 2021).
* The comparison with supervised baselines like BERT and T5-based rankers is common practice for evaluating the performance of unsupervised methods (e.g., Nogueira & Cho, 2019).

**Novel Aspects of Methodology:**

The core novelty of the methodology lies in the introduction of PRP. The authors justify this novel approach by highlighting the limitations of existing pointwise and listwise prompting methods for LLMs. They argue that PRP is a simpler and more natural way to leverage the LLM's capabilities for ranking.


## 5. Results in Context

**Main Results:**

* PRP variants based on FLAN-UL2 with 20B parameters achieve the best overall results on both TREC-DL and BEIR datasets.
* PRP outperforms the blackbox commercial GPT-4 based solution on some metrics and is only slightly inferior on others.
* PRP significantly outperforms other LLM-based solutions, including InstructGPT and various GPT-3 variants.
* PRP variants generalize well to smaller LLMs like FLAN-T5-XL and FLAN-T5-XXL.
* PRP is robust to input order, unlike listwise prompting methods.
* PRP performs competitively with supervised baselines on BEIR datasets.

**Comparison with Existing Literature:**

* The results on TREC-DL confirm the findings of Sun et al. (2023b) that GPT-4 can achieve strong ranking performance, but demonstrate that PRP can achieve comparable results with significantly smaller and more accessible LLMs.
* The results on BEIR extend the findings of Sun et al. (2023b) by showing that PRP can achieve competitive performance across a wider range of datasets and domains.
* The results contradict the general observation that LLMs struggle to achieve competitive ranking performance compared to fine-tuned baselines (Ma et al., 2023; Zhuang et al., 2023).
