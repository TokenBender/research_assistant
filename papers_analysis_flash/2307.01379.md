## 4. Experimental Methodology and Its Foundations

**Experimental Setup:** The authors evaluate their SAR method on a variety of "off-the-shelf" LLMs, including instruction-tuned models like Vicuna, WizardLM, and LLaMA-2-chat, and pre-trained models like OPT and LLaMA. They use several free-form question-answering datasets, such as CoQA, TriviaQA, SciQ, MedQA, and MedMCQA, to assess the performance of SAR across different domains. They employ Rouge-L and sentence similarity as correctness metrics and AUROC as the primary evaluation metric for uncertainty quantification.

**Foundations:**

* **Predictive Entropy (PE):** The authors use PE (Kadavath et al., 2022b) as a baseline method for uncertainty quantification.
* **Semantic Entropy (SE):** The authors compare SAR with SE (Kuhn et al., 2023), a method that addresses semantic equivalence in uncertainty quantification.
* **Sentence Similarity:** The authors leverage sentence similarity measures based on RoBERTa, MiniLM, and MPNet (Reimers and Gurevych, 2019b) to assess the relevance of sentences.
* **Novel Aspects:** The core novelty of the paper lies in the introduction of the SAR method, which explicitly addresses the generative inequality problem by shifting attention to relevant tokens and sentences. The authors justify this novel approach based on their observations of the unequal contribution of tokens and sentences to uncertainty.


## 5. Results in Context

**Main Results:**

* SAR consistently outperforms baseline methods (PE, LN-PE, SE) across various LLMs and datasets, achieving significant improvements in AUROC scores for uncertainty quantification.
* SAR demonstrates generation efficiency, achieving comparable or better performance with fewer generations compared to other methods.
