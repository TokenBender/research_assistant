**a. Introduction:**

- **Key Points:**
    - LLMs have exceptional contextual learning capabilities but are often limited by effective context length.
    - One solution is to provide attention layers with access to additional context in the form of (key, value) pairs.
    - However, as the number of documents increases, the proportion of relevant keys decreases, leading to a "distraction issue" where irrelevant keys overlap with relevant ones, making them difficult to distinguish.
    - The paper introduces Focused Transformer (FOT) to address this issue by employing a contrastive learning-inspired training process.
    - FOT enhances the structure of the (key, value) space, allowing for context extension.
    - The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of FOT by fine-tuning OpenLLaMA models, resulting in models named LONGLLAMA that exhibit advancements in long-context tasks.
