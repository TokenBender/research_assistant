This focus is appropriate given the paper's topic, but it might lead to a slight underrepresentation of works from other related fields, such as computer vision and natural language processing.


## 9. Final Summary

**Contribution to the Field:**

The paper makes a significant contribution to the field of multimodal LLMs by proposing a novel pipeline for generating high-quality visual instruction tuning datasets. This approach addresses limitations of existing datasets and allows for greater control over the diversity and content of the generated data. The results demonstrate that the model trained on the synthesized data achieves state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks.
