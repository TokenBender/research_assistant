### 3. Why do Transformer LLMs Fail to Generalize to Long Contexts?

- **Key Points:** This section delves into the theoretical and empirical analysis of the length generalization failure in LLMs. It identifies three key factors: (1) attention logit explosion due to unseen distances, (2) attention entropy explosion due to unseen numbers of tokens, and (3) the distinct feature space occupied by the initial tokens.

    a. **Claim:** "This follows from Theorem 1 in Kazemnejad et al. (2023), which proves that the absolute positions can be implicitly encoded in the outputs of tokens of a single attention layer, even without positional encodings in their construction."
    b. **Citation:** Kazemnejad et al. (2023)
    c. **Relevance:** This citation connects the paper's findings to existing work on the implicit encoding of positional information in LLMs, providing a theoretical foundation for the observation that the initial tokens occupy a distinct feature space.
