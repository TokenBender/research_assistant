### 2.4 Methodology

**Summary:** This section introduces the Alignment Fine-Tuning (AFT) paradigm, which aims to address the assessment misalignment problem. AFT involves three steps: fine-tuning with COT data, generating multiple COTs for each question, and calibrating the scores of these COTs using a novel Constraint Alignment (CA) loss. The CA loss ensures that positive COT scores are higher than negative ones while preventing model degradation through a constraint term.

**Significant Citations:**

* **Claim:** "To align the scoring behaviors of LLMs with the golden standard assessment, we need to design an objective to let the scores of all positive COTs in Gp larger than that of negative COTs in GN."
    * **Citation:** Su et al. (2022), Wang et al. (2022).
    * **Relevance:** This connects the authors' approach to the concept of contrastive learning, which is a common technique for aligning model outputs with desired targets.
* **Claim:** "Nevertheless, although the quality of negative COTs may not be as high as that of positive COTs, they still retain a respectable quality, as they are sampled from fine-tuned, powerful LLMs. We find that reducing their scores by Equation 6 without setting any constraint will result in the degradation of the LLMs."
    * **Citation:** (Implicitly referencing the potential for model degradation when only focusing on maximizing positive scores)
    * **Relevance:** This highlights the importance of the constraint term in the CA loss, which prevents the model from degrading while aligning scores.
* **Claim:** "Furthermore, we also delve deeply into recent ranking-based methods for alignment, such as DPO (Rafailov et al., 2023), PRO (Song et al., 2023a) and RRHF (Yuan et al., 2023b), and find that the constraint, which has been overlooked by these approaches, is also crucial for their effectiveness."
    * **Citation:** Rafailov et al. (2023), Song et al. (2023a), Yuan et al. (2023b).
