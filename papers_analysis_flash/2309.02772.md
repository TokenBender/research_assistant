  - **Explanation:** These citations provide the context for understanding temperature sampling and its limitations, which motivated the development of AdapT sampling.


**4. Experimental Methodology and Its Foundations:**

- **Experimental Setup:** The authors use three open-source LLMs (CodeGen, InCoder, and CodeGeeX) with varying parameter sizes. They evaluate the models on two popular code generation datasets: HumanEval and MBPP. The evaluation is performed in a zero-shot setting, meaning no examples are provided to the models. The primary evaluation metric is pass@k, which measures the percentage of generated code snippets that pass the associated test cases.
- **Foundations:**
    - The authors utilize the standard temperature sampling technique as a baseline, which is well-established in the literature (e.g., Ackley et al., 1985; Chen et al., 2021).
    - The choice of HumanEval and MBPP datasets is justified by their widespread use in the code generation research community (Chen et al., 2021; Austin et al., 2021).
- **Novel Aspects:**
    - The core novelty lies in the proposed AdapT sampling method, which dynamically adjusts the temperature coefficient based on the predicted difficulty of the next token.
    - The authors do not explicitly cite any specific work that directly inspired this novel approach, suggesting it is a unique contribution of their research.


**5. Results in Context:**

- **Main Results:** AdapT sampling consistently outperforms the SOTA temperature sampling method across all three LLMs and both datasets. It achieves a significant improvement in pass@15, particularly for CodeGeeX on HumanEval (13.6% improvement). The method also demonstrates robustness to hyperparameter variations.
- **Comparison with Existing Literature:**
    - The authors compare their results with the performance of greedy search and the SOTA temperature sampling method (SP).
    - The results show that AdapT sampling outperforms SP in most cases and achieves comparable performance to greedy search in terms of pass@1.
- **Confirmation, Contradiction, or Extension:**
    - The results confirm the existing understanding that increasing temperature can improve the diversity of generated code but can also introduce more errors (Chen et al., 2021).
    - The results extend the existing literature by demonstrating that dynamically adjusting the temperature based on token difficulty can significantly improve code generation accuracy.
