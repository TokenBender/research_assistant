## 4. Experimental Methodology and Its Foundations

**Experimental Setup:** The authors conduct experiments on two foundation model families: Vision Transformers (ViT) and Text-to-Text Transformers (T5). They train these models on large-scale datasets (JFT-4B and C4) using the original training recipes and incorporate gradual magnitude pruning during training. They systematically vary model size, sparsity levels, and training data to derive scaling laws.

**Foundations in Cited Works:**

* **Sparsification:** The authors utilize gradual magnitude pruning (GMP) (Zhu & Gupta, 2017) as their primary sparsification method.
* **Optimizer:** They primarily use AdaFactor (Shazeer & Stern, 2018) with modifications to handle sparsity during training.
* **Library:** They leverage the Jaxpruner library (Lee et al., 2023) for efficient implementation of their pruning strategy.

**Novel Aspects:**

* The authors extend the concept of scaling laws to incorporate sparsity, developing a joint scaling law that relates sparsity, model size, and training data. This is a novel contribution to the field.
* They introduce the concept of "optimal sparsity" and derive a method for determining it based on the joint scaling law.
* They investigate the impact of structured sparsity (n:m patterns) on scaling laws, extending their analysis beyond unstructured sparsity.
* They compare the efficiency of pruning pretrained models versus training sparse models from scratch, providing insights into practical applications of sparsity.


## 5. Results in Context

**Main Results:**

* The authors derive a joint scaling law that describes the relationship between sparsity, model size, and training data for foundation models.
* They demonstrate that optimal sparsity increases with longer training durations.
* They show that sparsity gains saturate quickly, with diminishing returns at higher sparsity levels.
* They find that pruning pretrained models is more efficient than training sparse models from scratch.
* They observe similar sparsity gains across vision and language domains.

**Comparison with Existing Literature:**

* **Scaling Laws:** The authors' scaling laws extend existing work on scaling laws (Kaplan et al., 2020; Hoffmann et al., 2022) by incorporating sparsity. Their results confirm the general power-law scaling behavior observed in previous studies but also reveal the unique impact of sparsity on model capacity.
* **Sparsity in Foundation Models:** The authors' findings contribute to the limited existing literature on sparsity in foundation models (Rae et al., 2021; Cerebras, 2022). Their results extend these previous studies by considering a wider range of model sizes, sparsity levels, and training data, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the impact of sparsity on these models.
* **Pruning Techniques:** The authors compare the effectiveness of GMP with other pruning techniques (AC/DC, STE, RigL) and find that GMP offers a good balance of performance and robustness for their experimental setup.
