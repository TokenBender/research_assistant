**Authors:** Sean O'Brien and Mike Lewis
**Publication Date:** September 29, 2023 (v2)
**Publication Venue:** arXiv preprint

**Main Objective:** This research aims to demonstrate that Contrastive Decoding, a computationally efficient text generation method, significantly improves the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) across various tasks, outperforming traditional methods like greedy decoding and nucleus sampling.

**Total Number of References:** 66


## 2. Section-by-Section Analysis with Citation Extraction

### 2.1 Introduction

**Summary:** The introduction establishes the context of text generation from LLMs, highlighting the common practice of using truncated sampling for open-ended generation and greedy decoding for reasoning tasks. It argues that this bifurcation is suboptimal and introduces reasoning errors. The authors then introduce Contrastive Decoding as a potential solution to this problem.

**Significant Citations:**

* **Claim:** "For open-ended text generation tasks, truncated sampling is normally used, as the most likely strings under a model tend to be short and uninteresting."
    * **Citation:** Holtzman et al. (2020), "The curious case of neural text degeneration", *Proceedings of the 58th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics*.
    * **Relevance:** This citation supports the authors' statement that truncated sampling is a common practice in open-ended text generation due to the tendency of LLMs to generate short and uninteresting outputs.
* **Claim:** "For reasoning problems, greedy decoding is normally preferred, to avoid risking sampling errors."
    * **Citation:** No specific citation is provided for this claim, but it's a common practice in the field of LLM reasoning.

### 2.2 Contrastive Decoding

**Summary:** This section introduces the core concept of Contrastive Decoding (CD), originally proposed by Li et al. (2022). It explains how CD searches for strings that maximize the difference in likelihood between a strong "expert" model and a weaker "amateur" model, effectively avoiding undesirable modes of the expert model's distribution.
