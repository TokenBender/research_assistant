    - **Relevance:** This citation establishes the context of MLLMs within the broader research landscape of LLMs and highlights the focus on comprehension capabilities.
- **Key Point:** Existing MLLMs typically enhance LLMs by incorporating images as multimodal inputs, such as CLIP features, to facilitate language-output multimodal comprehension.
    - **Citation:** (Radford et al., 2021)
    - **Relevance:** This citation introduces CLIP, a key concept in the paper, and emphasizes its role in existing multimodal comprehension approaches.

    - **Relevance:** This citation highlights the gap in existing research, focusing on the lack of exploration in multimodal creation capabilities.
- **Key Point:** Existing methods compel MLLMs to produce either discrete or continuous conditional embeddings that explicitly align with a pretrained CLIP encoder, which could later be used by a pretrained Stable Diffusion (SD) model for image generation.
    - **Citation:** (Koh et al., 2023; Sun et al., 2023b; Rombach et al., 2022)
    - **Relevance:** This citation describes the current state-of-the-art in multimodal creation, highlighting the reliance on CLIP and Stable Diffusion.
