## 4. Experimental Methodology and Its Foundations

**Experimental Setup:**

The experiments are conducted on the LVIS dataset, focusing on long-tailed instance segmentation and open-vocabulary object detection. The authors compare MosaicFusion with three baseline methods: Mask R-CNN, CenterNet2, and F-VLM. They evaluate the performance using average precision (AP) for both bounding boxes and instance masks. MosaicFusion utilizes Stable Diffusion v1.4 with the LMS scheduler and generates images with multiple objects based on user-defined text prompts.

**Foundations in Cited Works:**

* **Stable Diffusion (Rombach et al., 2022):** The core technology for image generation.
* **Mask R-CNN (He et al., 2017):** A standard object detection and instance segmentation model used as a baseline.
* **CenterNet2 (Zhou et al., 2022):** A more advanced instance segmentation model used as a baseline.
* **F-VLM (Kuo et al., 2023):** A state-of-the-art open-vocabulary object detection model used as a baseline.
* **LVIS dataset (Gupta et al., 2019):** The benchmark dataset for evaluating instance segmentation performance.

**Novel Aspects of Methodology:**

* **Multi-object Image Generation:** MosaicFusion is novel in its ability to generate multiple objects within a single image using diffusion models. The authors don't explicitly cite a work that directly inspired this approach, suggesting it's a novel contribution.
* **Mask Generation using Cross-Attention Maps:** The use of cross-attention maps from the diffusion model for generating instance masks is a novel approach. While attention mechanisms are well-established (Vaswani et al., 2017), their application in this specific context for mask generation is a novel contribution.


## 5. Results in Context

**Main Results:**

* MosaicFusion consistently improves the performance of both Mask R-CNN and CenterNet2 baselines on the LVIS long-tailed instance segmentation benchmark, with significant gains in AP for rare categories.
* MosaicFusion also improves the performance of the F-VLM baseline on the LVIS open-vocabulary object detection benchmark, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling novel categories.
* Ablation studies show that the number of generated objects, center jitter, overlapped pixels, text prompt design, category set, and the number of generated images per category all significantly impact the performance.
* Comparison with Mosaic and Copy-Paste shows that MosaicFusion is orthogonal to these methods and provides superior performance, especially for rare categories.
* Comparison with X-Paste demonstrates that MosaicFusion achieves competitive performance with significantly fewer generated images.
* Qualitative results show that the cross-attention maps effectively capture object structure and that MosaicFusion can generate high-quality multi-object images and masks.


**Comparison with Existing Literature:**

* **Confirmation:** The results confirm that diffusion models can be effectively used for data augmentation in instance segmentation (Baranchuk et al., 2022).
* **Extension:** The results extend the work on data augmentation by demonstrating the effectiveness of generating multiple objects within a single image, which is not explored in previous works like Copy-Paste (Ghiasi et al., 2021) or Mosaic (Bochkovskiy et al., 2020).
* **Contradiction:** The results contradict the assumption that simply combining single-object images generated by diffusion models would be as effective as generating multi-object images directly (Bochkovskiy et al., 2020).
