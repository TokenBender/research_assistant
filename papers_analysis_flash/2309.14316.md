- **Authors:** Zeyuan Allen-Zhu, Yuanzhi Li
- **Publication Date:** September 18, 2023 (version 3)
- **Objective:** The paper investigates whether large language models (LLMs) genuinely learn to extract knowledge from sources like Wikipedia or simply memorize similar questions encountered during training.
- **Number of References:** 42

**2. Section-by-Section Analysis with Citation Extraction:**

**a. Introduction:**

- **Key Points:**
    - LLMs can store vast amounts of world knowledge, often extractable through question-answering.
    - The paper focuses on factual knowledge (e.g., knowledge graph) that LLMs need to memorize from training data and extract later during inference.
    - The authors differentiate between "memorization of knowledge" in LLMs and traditional memorization in machine learning, emphasizing that the former doesn't necessarily imply the ability to extract knowledge flexibly.
    - The paper investigates this issue using a controlled biography dataset.
- **Significant Citations:**
    - **Claim:** "Memorization enables us to extract and manipulate knowledge from the sentences we read or hear, recognize the entities, relations, and facts expressed in the text, and apply logical and causal reasoning to infer new information or answer queries."
    - **Citation:** [4, 6, 12, 42]
    - **Explanation:** This citation supports the authors' claim that memorization is a crucial aspect of human knowledge acquisition and reasoning, providing a foundation for their investigation into how LLMs handle knowledge.
    - **Claim:** "This is distinct from in-context learning or RAG [22], where the model is given a paragraph during inference and immediately answers questions about it."
    - **Citation:** [22]
    - **Explanation:** This citation distinguishes the paper's focus on factual knowledge from other approaches like in-context learning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), highlighting the specific area of investigation.

    - bioS is a synthetic dataset with N = 100,000 individuals, where details are randomly and independently selected from a uniform distribution.
    - bioR is a "close-to-real" dataset generated by Llama, providing a more realistic representation of biographies.
    - The authors also introduce a QA dataset, which poses questions targeting the six unique attributes of each individual in the BIO datasets.
- **Significant Citations:**
    - **Claim:** "We also use Llama [37, 40] to rewrite them to make them close to real-life biography styles."
    - **Citation:** [37, 40]

**d. Result 1: Mixed Training ⇒ Knowledge Extraction:**

- **Key Points:**
    - The authors demonstrate that pretraining a model on all biographies plus QAs for a p fraction of individuals enables it to answer questions about the remaining 1-p fraction.
    - This mixed training approach deviates from typical human learning and is less frequently used in practical LLM pretraining.
- **Significant Citations:**
    - **Claim:** "This learning process deviates from typical human learning and is less frequently used in practical LLM pretrain (and perhaps it should!)."
    - **Citation:** None
    - **Explanation:** While the authors don't explicitly cite a work to support this claim, they implicitly suggest that the mixed training approach is less common in LLM pretraining, highlighting a potential area for future research.

**e. Result 2-3: INSTRUCT FINETUNE ⇒ KNOWLEDGE EXTRACTION (UNLESS DATA AUGMENTED):**

- **Key Points:**
    - A model pretrained only on biographies and then finetuned using QAs struggles to answer questions about the remaining individuals, regardless of model size, pre-train time, or finetune parameters.
    - Accuracy significantly improves with knowledge augmentations like varying writing styles or sentence shuffling.
    - This establishes a strong link between knowledge augmentation in pretraining data and knowledge extraction ability after finetuning.
- **Significant Citations:**
    - **Claim:** "Consider a model pretrained only on the biographies and then finetuned using QAs for a p fraction of individuals. We discover that it struggles to answer questions about the remaining 1-p fraction, irrespective of model size, pre-train time, or finetune parameters (Result 2)."
    - **Citation:** None
    - **Explanation:** This claim is based on the authors' own experimental findings, highlighting the importance of data augmentation for knowledge extraction.
    - **Claim:** "However, accuracy significantly improves with knowledge augmentations like varying writing styles or sentence shuffling (Result 3)."

**5. Results in Context:**

- **Main Results:**
    - Mixed training (pretraining on both BIO and QA data) enables knowledge extraction, but the model exhibits abnormal learning behavior akin to "studying to pass the test."
    - Pretraining exclusively on BIO data without knowledge augmentation leads to poor knowledge extraction after finetuning.
    - Knowledge augmentation (multiplicity, permutations, repeating full names) significantly improves knowledge extraction.
    - The inclusion of celebrity data enhances the model's knowledge extraction for minorities.
    - Bidirectional models like BERT struggle to extract knowledge after MLM pretraining, especially when the knowledge is not a standalone word or a set of independent words.
