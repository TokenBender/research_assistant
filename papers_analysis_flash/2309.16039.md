## 4. Experimental Methodology and Its Foundations

**Experimental Setup:**

The authors develop a series of long-context LLMs by continually pretraining from Llama 2 checkpoints. They gradually increase the context window during training, using a dataset where long texts are upsampled. They also employ a lightweight instruction tuning procedure that leverages a combination of RLHF data from Llama 2 Chat and synthetic self-instruct data generated by the model itself.
