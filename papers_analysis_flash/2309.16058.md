## 4. Experimental Methodology and Its Foundations

- **Experimental Setup:** AnyMAL is trained in two stages: pre-training and fine-tuning. 
    - **Pre-training:** Aligns various modalities (image, audio, video, IMU) to the LLM's text embedding space using projection layers. Utilizes large datasets for each modality (e.g., LAION-2B for images, AudioSet for audio).
    - **Fine-tuning:** Uses the MM-IT dataset to further improve instruction-following capabilities.
- **Foundations in Cited Works:**
    - **Modality Alignment:** The methodology builds upon the concept of multimodal few-shot learning with frozen language models [1] and extends it to a wider range of modalities. The use of projection layers is inspired by Flamingo [2].
    - **LLM Selection:** The choice of LLaMA-2 [6] as the base LLM is justified by its strong reasoning capabilities and open-source nature.
    - **Instruction Tuning:** The MM-IT dataset is inspired by works like LLaVA [20] and InstructBLIP [19], but it focuses on a more diverse set of instructions and modalities.
- **Novel Aspects:**
    - **Any-Modality:** The ability to handle multiple modalities beyond vision and language is a novel contribution. The authors justify this approach by highlighting the limitations of prior work that focused on single additional modalities.
    - **MM-IT Dataset:** The creation of a manually curated multimodal instruction dataset is a novel contribution. The authors justify this approach by arguing that existing datasets lack the diversity and quality needed for training robust multimodal LLMs.
    - **Quantization for Scalability:** The use of quantization techniques to train a 70B parameter model on a single GPU is a novel aspect of the methodology. The authors cite [40] to justify this approach.
