## 2. Section-by-Section Analysis with Citation Extraction


### 2.1 Introduction

**Summary:** The introduction establishes the context of generic feature extraction in computer vision, highlighting the shift from handcrafted features to deep learning methods. It emphasizes the importance of pretrained models for various tasks, especially when annotated data is scarce. The authors then introduce the concept of Vision Transformers and their recent success in self-supervised learning, particularly with the DINO and DINOv2 algorithms. They highlight the issue of artifacts in attention maps, which this paper aims to address.

**Significant Citations:**

* **Claim:** "Embedding images into generic features that can serve multiple purposes in computer vision has been a long-standing problem. First methods relied on handcrafted principles, such as SIFT (Lowe, 2004), before the scale of data and deep learning techniques allowed for end-to-end training."

    * **Relevance:** This citation establishes the historical context of feature extraction, showing the transition from traditional methods like SIFT to modern deep learning approaches.

* **Claim:** "In particular, the DINO algorithm is shown to produce models that contain explicit information about the semantic layout of an image. Indeed, qualitative results show that the last attention layer naturally focuses on semantically consistent parts of images and often produces interpretable attention maps."

### 2.2 Problem Formulation

**Summary:** This section dives deeper into the artifacts observed in the attention maps of ViTs, particularly focusing on DINOv2. It defines these artifacts as "high-norm outlier tokens" and describes their characteristics, such as their higher norm compared to other tokens and their tendency to appear in redundant image regions.

**Significant Citations:**

* **Claim:** "As shown in Fig. 2, most modern vision transformers exhibit artifacts in the attention maps. The unsupervised DINO backbone (Caron et al., 2021) has been previously praised for the quality of local features and interpretability of attention maps."

    * **Relevance:** This citation introduces DINOv2, the primary focus of the artifact analysis, and highlights its strong performance on dense prediction tasks, despite the presence of the artifacts.


### 2.3 Artifacts in the Local Features of DINOv2

**Summary:** This subsection provides a quantitative analysis of the artifacts, focusing on their high-norm characteristics. It also discusses the conditions under which these artifacts appear during training, such as model size and training duration.

**Significant Citations:**

* **Claim:** "We observe that an important difference between "artifact" patches and other patches is the norm of their token embedding at the output of the model."
    * **Citation:** (No direct citation, but builds upon the observations and analysis presented in the previous sections and figures, particularly Figure 3.)
    * **Relevance:** This claim is supported by the visual evidence presented in Figure 3, which shows the bimodal distribution of token norms in DINOv2, highlighting the outlier tokens.

* **Claim:** "Finally, when analyzing more closely models of different size (Tiny, Small, Base, Large, Huge and giant), we see that only the three largest models exhibit outliers (Fig. 4c)."
    * **Citation:** (No direct citation, but builds upon the observations and analysis presented in Figure 4c.)
    * **Relevance:** This claim is supported by the visual evidence presented in Figure 4c, which shows that the artifact tokens only appear in larger models, suggesting a relationship between model capacity and the emergence of these artifacts.


### 2.4 High-Norm Tokens Appear Where Patch Information is Redundant

**Summary:** This subsection explores the spatial distribution of the artifact tokens, suggesting that they tend to appear in areas with redundant information, such as background regions. It also investigates the information content of these tokens through linear probing experiments, finding that they hold less local information compared to normal tokens.

**Significant Citations:**

* **Claim:** "We observe that high-norm tokens appear on patches that are very similar to their neighbors."
    * **Citation:** (No direct citation, but builds upon the observations and analysis presented in Figure 5a.)
    * **Relevance:** This claim is supported by the visual evidence presented in Figure 5a, which shows the high cosine similarity between high-norm tokens and their neighbors, indicating redundancy in the local patch information.

* **Claim:** "We observe that high-norm tokens have much lower accuracy than the other tokens (Fig. 5b), suggesting they contain less information about their position in the image."
    * **Citation:** (No direct citation, but builds upon the observations and analysis presented in Figure 5b.)
    * **Relevance:** This claim is supported by the results of the linear probing experiment for position prediction shown in Figure 5b, which demonstrates that high-norm tokens perform poorly in predicting their position, suggesting a lack of local positional information.


### 2.5 Artifacts Hold Global Information

**Summary:** This subsection investigates whether the artifact tokens might contain global information about the image. It uses a linear probing experiment for image classification, finding that classifiers trained on these tokens achieve higher accuracy than those trained on normal tokens.

**Significant Citations:**

* **Claim:** "We see that outlier tokens have a much higher accuracy than the other tokens (Table 1)."
    * **Citation:** (No direct citation, but builds upon the observations and analysis presented in Table 1.)
    * **Relevance:** This claim is supported by the results of the linear probing experiment for image classification presented in Table 1, which shows that classifiers trained on high-norm tokens achieve significantly higher accuracy, suggesting that these tokens might encode global image information.


### 2.6 Hypothesis and Remediation

**Summary:** This section presents the authors' hypothesis that large, sufficiently trained models learn to identify and utilize redundant tokens to store and process global information. It proposes a simple solution: adding learnable "register" tokens to the input sequence, which the model can use to store this global information, effectively removing the artifact tokens.

**Significant Citations:**

* **Claim:** "We therefore propose a simple fix to this issue: we explicitly add new tokens to the sequence, that the model can learn to use as registers."

They use standard training procedures for each model, with the only modification being the inclusion of the register tokens after the patch embedding layer. They then evaluate the performance of these models on various downstream tasks, including image classification, semantic segmentation, depth estimation, and object discovery.

**Foundations in Cited Works:**

* **DeiT-III:** Touvron et al. (2022) - The authors use the DeiT-III training recipe as a baseline for supervised learning with ViTs.

**Novel Aspects of Methodology:**

* The introduction of "register" tokens as a novel approach to mitigate the artifacts in ViT feature maps. The authors cite Burtsev et al. (2020) to justify the use of additional tokens in the transformer sequence, but their specific application to address artifacts in vision transformers is novel.
