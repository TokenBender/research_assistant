## 4. Experimental Methodology and Its Foundations

**Experimental Setup:**

The paper evaluates the proposed Elephant Neural Networks (ENNs) across three continual learning tasks:

1. **Streaming Regression:** Approximating a sine function with a single-pass learning approach.
2. **Class Incremental Learning:** Classifying images from Split MNIST, Split CIFAR10, Split CIFAR100, and Split Tiny ImageNet datasets under strict constraints (no replay buffer, task boundaries, or pre-training).
3. **Reinforcement Learning:** Solving classic control tasks using Deep Q-Networks (DQN) with limited replay buffer sizes.

**Foundations in Cited Works:**

* **Streaming Regression:** The methodology is inspired by the general concept of streaming learning, where data arrives sequentially and the model updates in a single pass.
* **Class Incremental Learning:** The experimental setup is inspired by the work of Aljundi et al. (2019a) and others, but with stricter constraints, such as no task boundaries or replay buffers.
* **Reinforcement Learning:** The DQN algorithm (Mnih et al., 2013, 2015) is used as a baseline, and the experimental setup is inspired by the recent work of Lan et al. (2023) on memory-efficient reinforcement learning.

**Novel Aspects of Methodology:**

* **Elephant Activation Functions:** The core novelty lies in the introduction and application of the Elephant activation functions. The authors cite no specific work directly justifying this novel approach but build upon the existing literature on sparse representations and local elasticity.
* **Strict Class Incremental Learning Setup:** The authors impose stricter constraints on the class incremental learning task compared to many existing works, making their results more robust and highlighting the effectiveness of their approach in challenging scenarios.


## 5. Results in Context

**Main Results:**

* **Streaming Regression:** ENNs significantly outperform baselines (MLPs with classical activation functions and SR-NNs) in approximating a sine function in a streaming setting, achieving much lower MSE.
* **Class Incremental Learning:** ENNs achieve competitive performance on Split MNIST, Split CIFAR10, and Split CIFAR100, often outperforming baselines like Streaming EWC, SDMLP, and FlyModel, especially when task boundaries are not provided.
* **Reinforcement Learning:** ENNs with smaller replay buffers achieve comparable or better performance than MLPs with larger replay buffers in classic control tasks, demonstrating their ability to reduce catastrophic forgetting in RL.

**Comparison with Existing Literature:**

* **Streaming Regression:** The results confirm the limitations of sparse representations alone for continual learning and demonstrate the effectiveness of the Elephant activation functions in achieving local elasticity and reducing forgetting.
* **Class Incremental Learning:** The results confirm the findings of Mirzadeh et al. (2022a;b) that wider networks and better architectures can lead to improved continual learning performance. The authors' results also show that ENNs can achieve competitive performance even without task boundaries or replay buffers, which is a significant improvement over many existing methods.
* **Reinforcement Learning:** The results confirm the findings of Lan et al. (2023) that catastrophic forgetting can occur even in single RL tasks and that replay buffers can mask this issue. The authors' results demonstrate that ENNs can mitigate forgetting even with limited replay buffer sizes.
