**2.1 Introduction:**

- **Key Points:**
    - GPT-4 Code Interpreter demonstrates remarkable proficiency in solving math problems due to its ability to seamlessly reason with natural language, generate code, execute code, and continue reasoning based on the execution output. [OpenAI, 2023; Zhou et al., 2023a]
    - Open-source LLMs lag behind closed-source models in mathematical reasoning tasks, even with methods like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Program-Aided Language models (PAL). [Wei et al., 2022; Gao et al., 2023; Touvron et al., 2023; Penedo et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2022; Cobbe et al., 2021; Hendrycks et al., 2021; Zhou et al., 2023a]
    - Recent works like WizardMath and RFT attempt to improve open-source models' performance on math problems by fine-tuning them with math problems and CoT solutions. [Luo et al., 2023; Yuan et al., 2023]
    - Methods like PAL, PoT, and CSV encourage code usage in solving math problems, but open-source models still lack an effective recipe to match the performance of GPT-4 Code Interpreter. [Gao et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2023a]

**2.2 MathCoder Framework:**

- **Key Points:**
    - The paper introduces MathCoder, a framework designed to enhance the mathematical reasoning capabilities of open-source LLMs. [Zhou et al., 2023a]
    - MathCoder consists of two parts: (1) math instruction-following dataset construction and (2) customized supervised fine-tuning.
    - The instruction-following dataset, MathCodeInstruct, consists of 80k math problems and their corresponding solutions, interwoven with natural language for reasoning, code for execution, and execution results.
    - MathCodeInstruct is created in two steps: (1) collecting GPT-4 Code Interpreter-style solutions for GSM8K and MATH datasets and (2) augmenting more problems using a novel prompt called "problem interpolation." [Cobbe et al., 2021; Hendrycks et al., 2021; Yue et al., 2023]
    - The supervised fine-tuning stage uses special tokens to identify natural language, code, and execution results in the LCE solutions, enabling the model to learn to generate interleaved natural language and code. [Zhou et al., 2023a]
    - During inference, the model uses Jupyter Notebooks for code execution and appends the execution results to its predictions, allowing it to "see" the execution results and continue reasoning accordingly. [Zhou et al., 2023a]

**2.3 Experiments:**

- **Key Points:**
    - The paper evaluates MathCoder on five datasets: GSM8K, MATH, SVAMP, Mathematics, and SimulEq. [Cobbe et al., 2021; Hendrycks et al., 2021; Patel et al., 2021; Saxton et al., 2019; Kushman et al., 2014]
    - MathCoder outperforms other open-source models on all datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results. [Luo et al., 2023; Yuan et al., 2023; Touvron et al., 2023; Taylor et al., 2022; Anil et al., 2023; Zhao et al., 2023; OpenAI, 2023; Zhou et al., 2023a]
    - MathCoder-L-7B outperforms WizardMath-70B, demonstrating the advantage of using LCE solutions over CoT data. [Luo et al., 2023]
    - MathCoder models based on Llama-2-70B outperform CodeLlama-34B, suggesting that Llama-2's better natural language reasoning ability complements the code generation capabilities of CodeLlama. [Touvron et al., 2023; Rozière et al., 2023; Yue et al., 2023]
    - MathCoder-CL models with CodeLlama as the base model achieve a significant improvement in accuracy compared to MathCoder-L models with Llama-2 as the base model. [Rozière et al., 2023]
    - MathCoder performs well across various levels and subjects, demonstrating its ability to generalize to unknown circumstances and diverse fields of mathematics.
    - The ablation study shows that problem interpolation significantly improves the model's performance, highlighting the importance of dataset diversity.
    - Code execution during inference significantly improves the model's accuracy, confirming the findings of previous work on GPT-4 Code Interpreter. [Zhou et al., 2023a]
    - Excluding execution results from the training loss leads to a slight improvement in accuracy, suggesting that focusing on natural language and code generation during training can be more effective for math problem-solving.
