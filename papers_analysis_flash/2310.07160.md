Furthermore, we cannot access the raw logits of all baseline models (and these models do not all share the same tokenization scheme), so likelihood-based metrics, such as perplexity, are not possible to compute or compare across all models. Therefore we use human evaluation in this setting, which has been called the "gold standard" of chatbot evaluation (Touvron et al., 2023). We also provide additional quantitative evaluation results for these tasks in the supplement (Section E)."

For the test split of each dataset, we ask humans to compare captions from our model to those from the baseline models. Details on this procedure are given in Section J.1. The ordering of captions in the interface is always randomized."
