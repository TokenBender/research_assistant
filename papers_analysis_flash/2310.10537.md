## 4. Experimental Methodology and Its Foundations

**Experimental Setup:**

The authors used a custom CUDA library implemented in PyTorch to emulate MX formats on existing GPUs. They explored four different settings:

1. **Direct-cast Inference:** Quantized inference on a trained FP32 model.
2. **Error Diffusion Inference:** Post-training quantization (PTQ) using a calibration dataset.
3. **Finetuned Inference:** Quantization-aware finetuning on a trained FP32 model.
4. **Training:** Training from scratch with quantized operations in both forward and backward passes.

**Foundations in Cited Works:**
