### 2.1 Introduction

**Summary:** The introduction establishes the context of learning from human preferences, particularly in the field of natural language processing. It highlights the prevalent use of RLHF and its reliance on two key approximations: substituting pairwise preferences with pointwise rewards and assuming reward model generalization to out-of-distribution data. The authors introduce Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) as a method that bypasses the second approximation but still relies on the first. They then state their goal of developing a more general theoretical framework to understand these methods.

### 2.2 Background

**Summary:** This section provides a detailed overview of RLHF and DPO, the two primary methods the paper focuses on. It describes the two stages of RLHF: reward model learning (using Bradley-Terry model) and policy optimization with the learned reward. It also explains DPO as an alternative approach that directly optimizes the policy from human preferences without a reward model.

### 2.3 A General Objective for Preference Optimization

**Summary:** This section introduces the core contribution of the paper: a general objective function called Ψ-Preference Optimization (ΨPO). This objective function generalizes both RLHF and DPO by incorporating a non-decreasing function Ψ of preferences and a KL-regularization term. The authors argue that this general framework allows for a deeper understanding of the behavior of RLHF and DPO.

**Significant Citations:**

* **Claim:** "A central conceptual contribution of the paper is to propose a general objective for RLHF, based on maximizing a non-linear function of preferences."
    * **Citation:** (No direct citation for this claim, but it builds upon the previous discussion of RLHF and DPO, particularly the limitations of DPO).
    * **Relevance:** This claim introduces the core contribution of the paper, the ΨPO objective.
* **Claim:** "This objective balances the maximisation of a potentially non-linear function of preference probabilities with the KL regularisation term which encourages policies to be close to the reference πref."
    * **Citation:** (No direct citation for this claim, but it builds upon the previous discussion of RLHF and DPO, particularly the KL-regularization term).
    * **Relevance:** This claim explains the key components of the ΨPO objective, highlighting its ability to balance preference maximization and policy regularization.


### 2.4 A Deeper Analysis of DPO and RLHF

**Summary:** This section delves into a deeper analysis of DPO and RLHF, showing that they can be viewed as special cases of ΨPO. It demonstrates that under the Bradley-Terry model assumption, the optimal policies for RLHF, DPO, and ΨPO are identical. The authors then discuss the potential pitfalls of both methods, particularly the risk of overfitting due to the strong assumption of pairwise preferences being substitutable with Elo-scores.

**Significant Citations:**

* **Claim:** "We first connect DPO and RLHF with the Ψ-preference objective in Equation (6), under the special choice of Ψ(q) = log(q/(1 - q))."
    * **Citation:** (No direct citation for this claim, but it builds upon the previous discussion of RLHF, DPO, and ΨPO).
    * **Relevance:** This claim establishes the connection between the ΨPO objective and the specific objectives of RLHF and DPO.
* **Claim:** "Assuming that p*(y > y'|x) conforms to the Bradley-Terry model, one can show that as the size of the dataset D grows, p(y > y'|x) becomes a more and more accurate estimate of true p*(y > y'|x) and in the limit converges to p*(y > y'|x)."

    * **Relevance:** This citation reinforces the importance of the Bradley-Terry model in the context of preference modeling.
* **Claim:** "This is due to the fact that those methods rely on the strong assumption that pairwise preferences can be substituted with Elo-score (pointwise rewards) via a Bradley-Terry (BT) modelisation (Bradley and Terry, 1952)."

    * **Relevance:** This citation highlights the crucial assumption made by RLHF and DPO, which can lead to overfitting.


### 2.5 Weak Regularization and Overfitting

**Summary:** This section discusses the potential issues of overfitting in DPO and RLHF, particularly when preferences are deterministic or nearly deterministic. The authors explain how the non-linear transformation of preferences in these methods can lead to counter-intuitive behavior and highlight the importance of KL-regularization in mitigating this issue. They also discuss why RLHF might be more robust to overfitting in practice due to the implicit regularization provided by the reward model training process.

**Significant Citations:**

* **Claim:** "The weakness of the KL-regularisation becomes even more pronounced in the finite data regime, where we only have access to a sample estimate of the preference p(y > y')."
    * **Citation:** (No direct citation for this claim, but it builds upon the previous discussion of KL-regularization and its role in DPO and RLHF).
    * **Relevance:** This claim highlights the challenges of KL-regularization in the finite data regime, where overfitting can be a significant issue.
* **Claim:** "This underfitting of the reward function is thus crucial in obtaining a final policy that is sufficiently regularised towards the reference policy πref, and DPO, in avoiding the training of the reward function, loses the regularisation of the policy that the underfitted reward function affords."
    * **Citation:** Christiano, P., Leike, J., Brown, T., Martic, M., Legg, S., & Amodei, D. (2017). Deep reinforcement learning from human preferences. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems.
    * **Relevance:** This citation emphasizes the importance of the reward model in RLHF, particularly its role in providing implicit regularization.


### 2.6 IPO: ΨPO with Identity Mapping

**Summary:** This section introduces Identity-PO (IPO), a specific instance of ΨPO where the function Ψ is set to the identity function. The authors argue that IPO addresses the overfitting issues of DPO by directly optimizing the total preferences while maintaining KL-regularization. They derive a computationally efficient algorithm for IPO based on root-finding problems and provide a sampled loss function for empirical optimization.

**Significant Citations:**

* **Claim:** "This analysis of DPO motivates choices of Ψ which are bounded, ensuring that the KL regularisation in Equation 6 remains effective even in the regime of {0,1}-valued preferences, as it is often the case when working with empirical datasets."
    * **Citation:** (No direct citation for this claim, but it builds upon the previous discussion of DPO and its overfitting issues).
    * **Relevance:** This claim justifies the need for a bounded Ψ function, leading to the introduction of IPO.
* **Claim:** "As with DPO, it will be beneficial to re-express Equation (8) as an offline learning objective. To derive such an expression, we begin by following the derivation of Rafailov et al. (2023), manipulating the analytic expression for the optimal policy into a system of root-finding problems."

The authors analyze the behavior of both methods in asymptotic and sampled preference scenarios, highlighting IPO's ability to avoid greedy policies and prevent the exclusion of actions, unlike DPO.
