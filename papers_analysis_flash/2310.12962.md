* **Broader Context for EFT:** While the authors connect EFT to reinforcement learning and KL-divergence, they could potentially benefit from citing more works that explore the use of KL-divergence in other NLP tasks or domains. This would provide a broader context for the EFT framework and highlight its potential applicability beyond the specific task of LLM fine-tuning.
* **Discussion of Alternative Approaches:** The authors could potentially benefit from discussing alternative approaches to decoupling pre-training and fine-tuning, such as methods that involve manipulating the training data or modifying the model architecture. This would provide a more comprehensive overview of the research landscape and strengthen the argument for the novelty of EFT.

**Potential Biases:**

The authors primarily cite works from leading research groups in the field of deep learning and NLP, which is understandable given the nature of the research. However, there is a potential bias towards citing works published in top-tier conferences and journals, which might overlook potentially relevant contributions from less prominent researchers or publications.


## 9. Final Summary

**Contribution to the Field:**

This paper makes a significant contribution to the field of LLM research by introducing the EFT framework, a novel technique for decoupling the scales of pre-training and fine-tuning. EFT enables a more nuanced understanding of how these two stages contribute to model capabilities and offers practical benefits, such as reduced computational cost and the ability to dynamically adjust behavioral traits at test time.
