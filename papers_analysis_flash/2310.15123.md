For constrained text generation, they use a modified CommonGen dataset, requiring the generation of coherent stories incorporating a set of concepts.
- **Foundations in Cited Works:**
  - **LLM Programs:** The authors draw inspiration from the concept of LLM programs (Schlag et al., 2023; Dohan et al., 2022), which involve breaking down complex tasks into smaller, modular steps.
  - **Task Decomposition:** The authors leverage the idea of task decomposition (Khot et al., 2022), breaking down complex tasks into sub-tasks that can be solved independently.
  - **Prompt Engineering:** The authors utilize advanced prompting techniques (Khot et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2022) to guide the LLM through the different stages of the BSM process.
