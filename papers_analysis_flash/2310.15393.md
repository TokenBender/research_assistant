## 4. Experimental Methodology and Its Foundations

- **Experimental Setup:** The experiments are primarily conducted on the SlimPajama dataset, which is a deduplicated version of RedPajama. The authors train a small-scale proxy model (82M parameters) to learn domain weights using DOGE. These weights are then used to train larger base models (124M, 210M, 684M parameters). The evaluation includes language modeling perplexity and few-shot reasoning accuracy across various tasks.

- **Foundations:** The methodology is based on the concept of bi-level optimization, which is related to works like Grangier et al. (2023) and Zhou et al. (2023). The authors also draw inspiration from DOREMI (Xie et al., 2023a), but they propose a simpler and more efficient approach.

- **Novel Aspects:** The core novelty lies in the formulation of the bi-level optimization problem for domain weighting, where the outer loop optimizes domain weights to maximize generalization to target domains, and the inner loop updates the proxy model using the current domain weights. The authors also introduce the concept of generalization estimation, which is used to quantify the alignment of learning tasks across domains.


## 5. Results in Context

- **Main Results:** DOGE consistently outperforms baseline methods (uniform domain weights, DOREMI) in both universal and out-of-domain generalization scenarios. It achieves lower perplexity and higher few-shot reasoning accuracy on the SlimPajama dataset. The authors also demonstrate that DOGE is robust to the scale of the proxy model and requires fewer training steps than DOREMI.

- **Comparison with Existing Literature:** The results confirm the hypothesis that optimizing domain weights can significantly improve LLM generalization. They also show that DOGE is a more efficient and robust approach than DOREMI, which is more sensitive to the capacity of the auxiliary models.

- **Confirmation/Contradiction/Extension:** The results confirm the findings of previous work that highlighted the importance of data quality and composition for LLM pretraining (Kaplan et al., 2020; Hoffmann et al., 2022; Longpre et al., 2023). However, DOGE extends this research by providing a more principled and efficient method for optimizing domain weights.


## 6. Discussion and Related Work

- **Situating the Work:** The authors situate their work within the broader context of data selection and data reweighting for LLM pretraining. They discuss the limitations of existing methods, such as classifier-based filtering and importance resampling, highlighting the need for a more scalable and efficient approach.
