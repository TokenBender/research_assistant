* **Adam Optimizer:** Kingma & Ba (2014) provides the foundation for the use of the Adam optimizer for training.


**Novel Aspects of Methodology:**

* **General-Purpose Generative Pre-training:** The authors propose a novel approach of pre-training a generative model for speech without any specific task in mind. This is a departure from previous work that focused on task-specific generative models. They cite related work like Voicebox (Le et al., 2023) to highlight the connection and contrast their approach.
* **Masked Audio Conditioning:** While masked audio modeling has been used in discriminative tasks, the authors apply it to generative pre-training, which is a novel approach. They cite Baevski et al. (2020) and Hsu et al. (2021) to justify this approach.


## 5. Results in Context

**Main Results:**

* **Speech Enhancement:** SpeechFlow achieves comparable or better performance than existing expert models on the Voicebank-Demand and WSJ0-CHiME3 datasets.
* **Speech Separation:** SpeechFlow achieves comparable performance to existing expert models on the LibriMix dataset.
* **Text-to-Speech Synthesis:** SpeechFlow achieves comparable performance to existing expert models on the filtered Librispeech dataset in zero-shot speaker adaptation.


**Comparison with Existing Literature:**

* **Speech Enhancement:** SpeechFlow's performance is comparable to or better than Conv-TasNet (Luo & Mesgarani, 2019), MetricGAN+ (Fu et al., 2021), DEMUCS (Défossez et al., 2020), and SGMSE+ (Richter et al., 2023).
* **Speech Separation:** SpeechFlow's performance is comparable to Conv-TasNet (Luo & Mesgarani, 2019) and SepFormer (Subakan et al., 2021, 2023).
* **Text-to-Speech Synthesis:** SpeechFlow's performance is comparable to YourTTS (Casanova et al., 2021), VALL-E (Wang et al., 2023), and Voicebox (Le et al., 2023) in zero-shot speaker adaptation.
