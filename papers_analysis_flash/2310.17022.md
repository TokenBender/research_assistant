The main results of the paper demonstrate that:

* **Blockwise CD-Q consistently achieves better reward-KL tradeoffs than tokenwise CD-Q and KL-regularized RL methods (PPO, DPO, IPO) across various tasks.** This finding is supported by comparisons with existing methods and is consistent with observations from other works (Gao et al., 2023; Rafailov et al., 2023).
* **CD prefix scorers can be transferred to unseen base models without retraining, showcasing robustness and flexibility.** This result extends the applicability of CD to a wider range of language models.
* **Blockwise CD-Q achieves comparable performance to best-of-K with significantly smaller K values.** This finding highlights the efficiency benefits of blockwise CD.

The authors compare their results with baselines like best-of-K, KL-regularized PPO, DPO, and IPO. Their results generally show that CD-Q, particularly in its blockwise variant, offers a favorable balance between reward and KL divergence, often outperforming these baselines.
