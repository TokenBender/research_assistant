    - **Broader Context for FP8:** While the authors discuss the challenges and benefits of FP8, they could have provided a more comprehensive overview of the broader research landscape surrounding FP8 in different domains (e.g., computer vision, signal processing).
    - **More Diverse Citation Sources:** The authors primarily cite works from major conferences and journals in the field of deep learning. Including citations from other relevant fields (e.g., hardware, numerical analysis) could have provided a more holistic perspective.
    - **Discussion of Potential Drawbacks:** While the authors highlight the benefits of FP8, they could have provided a more in-depth discussion of the potential drawbacks, such as the challenges associated with debugging and maintaining numerical stability in FP8.

- **Potential Biases:** The authors primarily cite works from major research labs and institutions, such as Google, Microsoft, and Nvidia. This is not necessarily a bias, but it's important to note that the selection of cited works might reflect the dominant research trends within these institutions.


## 9. Final Summary

- **Contribution to the Field:** This paper makes a significant contribution to the field of LLM training by introducing a novel FP8 mixed-precision framework that achieves comparable accuracy to BF16 while significantly reducing training costs (memory and time). The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach across various LLM tasks, including pre-training, instruction tuning, and RLHF.
