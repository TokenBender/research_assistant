   - The discussion of the trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency in quantization could benefit from more detailed comparisons of different quantization techniques across a wider range of LLMs and datasets.
- **Potential Biases:** The authors primarily cite works from the deep learning and machine learning communities, which is appropriate given the topic of the paper. However, there might be a slight bias towards works published in top-tier conferences and journals, potentially overlooking some valuable contributions from other venues.


## 9. Final Summary
