**2.1 Introduction**

- **Summary:** This section introduces the concept of vision-language models (VLMs) and their applications in various tasks like image captioning, visual question answering, and visual grounding. It highlights the challenges of training large VLMs from scratch and the popularity of shallow alignment methods like InstructBLIP and MiniGPT-4. It also points out the limitations of shallow alignment methods due to the mismatch between frozen language model weights and visual features.

    g. "The primary challenge in the performance of shallow alignment methods within VLMs can be attributed to the lack of deep fusion between visual and linguistic data. Shallow alignment methods struggle because they rely on 'frozen' language model weights, which are intrinsically trained to process text tokens. This presents a significant mismatch..." (This claim sets the stage for the proposed solution of CogVLM.)

It explains how the visual expert module is integrated into the language model to achieve deep fusion of visual and linguistic features. The section also covers the datasets used for pretraining and instruction alignment, including LAION-2B, COYO-700M, and various VQA and visual grounding datasets.
