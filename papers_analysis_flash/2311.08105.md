## 4. Experimental Methodology and Its Foundations

**Experimental Setup:** The authors evaluate DiLoCo using the C4 dataset for language modeling. They employ three different model sizes based on the Chinchilla architecture and compare DiLoCo's performance against several baselines, including fully synchronous training with varying batch sizes and training from scratch. The experiments are conducted in both i.i.d. and non-i.i.d. data settings.

**Foundations in Cited Works:**

* **Federated Averaging:** The core methodology of DiLoCo is based on Federated Averaging (FedAvg) (McMahan et al., 2017).
* **FedOpt:** DiLoCo builds upon the FedOpt algorithm (Reddi et al., 2021), which incorporates momentum-based optimization.
* **AdamW:** The inner optimizer used in DiLoCo is AdamW (Kingma and Ba, 2014; Loshchilov and Hutter, 2019), a widely used optimizer for transformer models.
* **Nesterov Momentum:** The outer optimizer used in DiLoCo is Nesterov momentum (Sutskever et al., 2013), chosen for its empirical effectiveness.

**Novel Aspects of Methodology:**

* **Large Inner Steps (H):** DiLoCo uses a large number of inner optimization steps before communicating gradients, which is a key innovation that reduces communication overhead. The authors cite (Wortsman et al., 2022a) to support the idea that communicating at the end of training is suboptimal.
* **AdamW as Inner Optimizer:** While AdamW is commonly used for transformer models, its use as the inner optimizer in a federated learning context is a novel aspect of DiLoCo.
* **Nesterov Momentum as Outer Optimizer:** The use of Nesterov momentum as the outer optimizer is also a novel aspect of DiLoCo, and the authors provide empirical evidence for its effectiveness.
