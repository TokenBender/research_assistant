    b. **Citation:** [25]
    c. **Relevance:** This explains the common parallel training strategies used for LLMs, providing context for the paper's focus on pipeline parallelism.

    a. "Pipeline parallelism is commonly adopted in LLM training [25]: the large model is partitioned into stages deployed over multiple devices; the input mini-batch of training samples in each training iteration is partitioned into micro-batches, and the micro-batches are processed across the devices in a pipelining manner."
    b. **Citation:** [25]
    c. **Relevance:** This introduces the concept of pipeline parallelism, which is a key component of the proposed DynaPipe approach.

    a. "Since almost all current language models use the Transformer [34] architecture, attention is computed among tokens in each long sequence during training and such attention computation is wasted among unrelated samples packed into the same sequence."
