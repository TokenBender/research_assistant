## 4. Experimental Methodology and Its Foundations

- **Experimental Setup:** The paper uses the Llama-2-7b language model as the base model. Four LoRA adapters are fine-tuned on four different datasets (GSM8K, ARC-Challenge, CodeAlpaca-20k, and SQuAD) to specialize in mathematical, scientific, coding, and reading comprehension tasks, respectively. The proposed token-level adaptation method dynamically selects and combines these adapters based on the input prompt's embedding.
- **Foundations:**
    - The use of LoRA for parameter-efficient fine-tuning is based on the work of **Hu et al. (2021)** [8].

- **Novel Aspects:** The novel aspect is the token-level adaptation of LoRA adapters using a gradient-free routing function based on cosine similarity. The authors justify this approach by referencing the work of **Fedus et al. (2022)** [4] on gradient-free routing in MoE models and the efficiency gains achieved by not computing the output of all experts for every token.


## 5. Results in Context

- **Main Results:** The token-level adaptation method outperforms the base Llama-2-7b model across all four tasks. It also achieves better average performance than models fine-tuned for each individual task, particularly when the expert adapter is updated every other token.
