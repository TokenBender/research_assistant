**4. Experimental Methodology and Its Foundations**

- **Experimental Setup:** The paper evaluates LQ-LoRA on three main tasks: continual language modeling, instruction tuning, and GLUE benchmark. It uses LLaMA-2 and RoBERTa models as the primary subjects for finetuning. The experiments involve comparing LQ-LoRA against QLoRA and GPTQ-LoRA baselines across various bit-widths and model sizes.
- **Foundations in Cited Works:**
    - The methodology for LoRA adaptation is based on **Hu et al., 2022** (*Lora: Low-rank adaptation of large language models*).
    - The NF quantization scheme is based on **Dettmers et al., 2023a** (*Qlora: Efficient finetuning of quantized llms*) and **Yoshida, 2023** (*Nf4 isn't information theoretically optimal (and that's good)*).
    - The ILP-based mixed quantization strategy is inspired by works like **Yao et al., 2021** (*Hawq-v3: Dyadic neural network quantization*) and **Tang et al., 2022** (*Mixed-precision neural network quantization via learned layer-wise importance*).
    - The Fisher-weighted SVD approach is inspired by **Hsu et al., 2022** (*Language model compression with weighted low-rank factorization*).
- **Novel Aspects:**
    - The core novelty lies in the **low-rank plus quantized matrix decomposition** approach within LoRA.
    - The **ILP-based mixed quantization strategy** for dynamic bit allocation across layers is a novel contribution.
    - The **Fisher-weighted SVD** for data-aware matrix decomposition is a novel application within the context of LQ-LoRA.
    - The authors justify these novel approaches by connecting them to existing concepts like RPCA and Fisher information, and by demonstrating their effectiveness through experiments.
