### 2.4 Approach

**Summary:** This section details the architecture of the autoregressive LVM. It describes the two-stage approach: (1) image tokenization using a VQGAN [30] model and (2) sequence modeling using a transformer architecture similar to LLaMA [80]. The authors emphasize the importance of treating all visual sentences equally, without relying on task-specific tokens.

**Significant Citations:**

* **Claim:** "We adopt the latter approach since the discrete categorical output from a model naturally forms a probabilistic distribution that one can easily sample from, enabling flexible conditional generation of new images within a visual sentence."
    * **Relevance:** This justifies the choice of using a VQGAN-based tokenizer, highlighting its ability to generate a probabilistic distribution of visual tokens, which is crucial for the autoregressive model.

    * **Relevance:** This directly connects the authors' approach to the VQGAN model, acknowledging its role in generating the visual tokens that form the input to the transformer.
* **Claim:** "We add a [BOS] (begin of sentence) token to the beginning of each visual sentence and an [EOS] (end of sentence) token to the end, and use sequence concatenation [19] during training."

    * **Relevance:** This demonstrates how the authors adapt techniques from language modeling to the visual domain, specifically using special tokens to indicate the beginning and end of visual sentences.


### 2.5 Experimental Results and Analysis

**Summary:** This section presents the experimental results, focusing on scalability, sequential prompting, and analogy prompting. It demonstrates that the LVM scales well with model size and data, achieving improved performance on various downstream tasks.

**Significant Citations:**

* **Claim:** "Since all our models are trained for only one epoch on the dataset, the model sees a given data sample just once, and therefore the training loss at any point during training is very similar to the validation loss."
    * **Relevance:** This explains the experimental setup, justifying the use of a single epoch for training and highlighting the close relationship between training and validation loss in this context.
* **Claim:** "We evaluate these tasks on the ImageNet validation set and generate all the annotations using the corresponding method described in Sec. 3."

    * **Relevance:** This clarifies the evaluation methodology, demonstrating how the authors use ImageNet as a benchmark for evaluating the performance of their model on various downstream tasks.
* **Claim:** "We observe that each data component contributes positively to the downstream tasks. LVM not only benefits from larger data, but also improves with more diversity in the dataset, which includes both annotated and unsupervised image and video data."
