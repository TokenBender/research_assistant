    - **Supporting Citations:** Hu et al. (2022), "LoRA: Low-rank adaptation of large language models." *ICLR*.
    - **Explanation:** Hu et al. (2022) introduced LoRA and its scaling factor, but the current paper demonstrates that this scaling factor is overly aggressive for higher ranks.

- **Insight 2:** The optimal scaling factor for LoRA adapters is proportional to the inverse square root of the rank.
    - **Supporting Citations:** Yang & Hu (2022), "Feature learning in infinite-width neural networks."
    - **Explanation:** The paper leverages the theoretical framework of Yang & Hu (2022) to derive the optimal scaling factor, ensuring stable learning trajectories.
