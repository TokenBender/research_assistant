**2.2 Chain of Code: Reasoning with an LMulator**

- **Key Points:** Introduces the core concept of Chain of Code (CoC), which encourages LLMs to generate code that can be executed by a code interpreter or emulated by the LLM itself (LMulator) for undefined behaviors. Explains the benefits of this approach, including the combination of code's structure and LLM's semantic understanding.
- **Significant Citations:**

    a. **Claim:** "Code in particular is advantageous because it provides both (i) a general syntactic structure to build and encode complex programs (Liang et al., 2023) (e.g., logic structures, functional vocabularies – in ways that are Turing complete), and (ii) an interface by which existing APIs paired together with an interpreter can be used to perform precise algorithmic computations (e.g., from multiplication of large numbers to sorting an array of size 10,000) that a language model trained only to mimic the statistically most likely next token would otherwise struggle to produce."
    b. **Citation:** Liang, J., Huang, W., Xia, F., Xu, P., Hausman, K., Ichter, B., Florence, P., and Zeng, A. Code as policies: Language model programs for embodied control. In 2023 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), pp. 9493–9500. IEEE, 2023.
    c. **Relevance:** This citation emphasizes the advantages of using code for complex reasoning tasks, highlighting its structured nature and ability to interface with external tools and APIs. It supports the core argument of CoC by demonstrating the potential of code-based reasoning.

    a. **Claim:** "While writing and executing code may improve LM reasoning performance across a wide range of arithmetic tasks, this particular approach contends with the fact that many semantic tasks are rather difficult (and at times, nearly impossible) to express in code. For example, it remains unclear how to write a function that returns a boolean when it detects sarcasm in a string (Suzgun et al., 2022) (handling the edge cases would be insurmountable)."

    c. **Relevance:** This citation acknowledges the limitations of solely relying on code for semantic tasks, particularly those involving complex concepts like sarcasm detection. It sets the stage for the introduction of the LMulator as a way to bridge this gap.

    a. **Claim:** "CoC inherits the benefits of both (i) writing executable code (where precise algorithmic computations are left to an interpreter), and (ii) writing pseudocode for semantic problems, and generating their outputs (which can be thought of as a simple formatting change, to which LMs are robust (Min et al., 2022)) – enabling the LM to "think in code”. "

    c. **Relevance:** This citation highlights the robustness of LLMs to minor formatting changes, specifically in the context of pseudocode. It justifies the use of pseudocode within the CoC framework, which allows for a more flexible and expressive representation of semantic sub-tasks.
