### 2.1 Introduction

**Summary:** The introduction highlights the challenge of scaling visual and language models due to power-law scaling, where performance improvements require significant increases in computation and data. It introduces active learning as a potential solution to improve data efficiency but notes that existing methods often fail to generalize across models and tasks, scale to large datasets, or achieve overall FLOP savings. The authors propose a novel method that addresses these limitations using small proxy models to estimate data learnability.
