    - CBQ consistently outperforms existing PTQ methods in terms of accuracy and perplexity on various datasets and models.
    - CBQ achieves superior performance in low-bit quantization settings (W4A4, W2A16), reducing the accuracy gap with full-precision models.
    - Ablation studies demonstrate the importance of cross-block dependency, LoRA-Rounding, and coarse-to-fine preprocessing for CBQ's performance.
- **Comparison with Existing Literature:**
    - **GPTQ:** CBQ outperforms GPTQ in most cases, particularly in low-bit settings.
    - **OmniQuant:** CBQ outperforms OmniQuant, demonstrating the benefits of cross-block dependency.
    - **QLLM:** CBQ outperforms QLLM, suggesting that the combination of cross-block dependency and LoRA-Rounding is more effective.
    - **RPTQ:** CBQ outperforms RPTQ in the W4A8 setting, highlighting the benefits of LoRA-Rounding.
- **Confirmation, Contradiction, or Extension:**
    - **Confirmation:** CBQ's results confirm the importance of outlier handling and adaptive rounding in PTQ, as suggested by previous works like SmoothQuant, Outlier Suppression, and AdaRound.
    - **Extension:** CBQ extends existing PTQ methods by introducing cross-block dependency and a more comprehensive outlier handling approach, leading to improved performance, particularly in low-bit settings.
