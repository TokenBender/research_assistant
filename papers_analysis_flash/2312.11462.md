### 2.3 Cascade Speculative Drafting

**Summary:** This section introduces the proposed CS Drafting algorithm, which incorporates two cascades: the Vertical Cascade and the Horizontal Cascade. The Vertical Cascade aims to eliminate autoregressive generation from neural draft models by using a hierarchy of progressively smaller models, culminating in a statistical language model. The Horizontal Cascade optimizes token allocation by assigning larger models to generate more crucial tokens and smaller models for less important tokens.

**Significant Citations:**

- **Claim:** "A notable inefficiency of the speculative decoding algorithm is the reliance on the autoregressive generation of a smaller draft model."
  - **Citation:** Leviathan et al. (2023)
  - **Relevance:** This identifies a key inefficiency in the existing speculative decoding approach that the Vertical Cascade aims to address. The citation to Leviathan et al. (2023) provides context for this inefficiency.

- **Claim:** "Additionally, we incorporate lenience, a hyperparameter that loosens the review process by the target model, allowing for faster speed at the trade-off of potentially differing results from the target model (Leviathan et al., 2023)."
  - **Citation:** Leviathan et al. (2023)
  - **Relevance:** This introduces the concept of lenience, a hyperparameter used in speculative decoding to control the trade-off between speed and accuracy. The citation to Leviathan et al. (2023) provides the original context for this concept.

- **Claim:** "Inspired by this observation, we designed Horizontal Cascade, an approach that improves time allocation by draft token allocation."
  - **Citation:** (None explicitly cited for this specific claim, but the general concept of token importance and its impact on efficiency is implied by the analysis of Figure 2.)
  - **Relevance:** This introduces the Horizontal Cascade, a novel aspect of the CS Drafting algorithm. While not explicitly cited, the authors' analysis of the token acceptance rate in Figure 2 provides the empirical basis for this design choice.


### 2.4 Max-Gram for Better Statistical Drafting

**Summary:** This section describes the Max-Gram (MaG) algorithm, a statistical language model designed to improve the efficiency of the statistical draft model used in the Vertical Cascade. MaG leverages the frequent reappearance of words and phrases from the input query in the generated text.

**Significant Citations:**

- **Claim:** "In our pursuit of a more effective statistical language model, we noticed a general pattern: in language model generation, some words and phrases from the input query frequently reappear in the generated content."
  - **Citation:** (None explicitly cited for this specific observation, but the general concept of pattern recognition in language models is common knowledge in the field.)
  - **Relevance:** This introduces the core idea behind the Max-Gram algorithm. While not explicitly cited, the observation of patterns in language generation is a common practice in NLP research.


### 2.5 Algorithm

**Summary:** This section presents the complete CS Drafting algorithm, combining the Vertical and Horizontal Cascades. It highlights the role of the MaG model as the smallest draft model and the use of hyperparameters to control the cascade depth.

**Significant Citations:**

- **Claim:** "The algorithm requires an upper-triangular hyperparameter, Knn, with each row serving as the stop criteria for a layer of recursive calls."
  - **Citation:** (None explicitly cited for this specific design choice, but the general concept of using hyperparameters to control the depth of a recursive algorithm is common practice.)
  - **Relevance:** This explains the use of hyperparameters in the algorithm. While not explicitly cited, the use of hyperparameters to control the behavior of algorithms is a standard practice in machine learning.


### 2.6 Analysis

**Summary:** This section provides a theoretical analysis of the CS Drafting algorithm, focusing on the expected walltime improvement factor (EWIF). It analyzes the EWIF of both the Vertical and Horizontal Cascades using generating functions.

  - **Citation:** West (2021)
  - **Relevance:** This introduces the mathematical framework used for the analysis. The citation to West (2021) provides the foundational knowledge of generating functions used in the analysis.

- **Claim:** "Despite the simple setting of EWIF, Leviathan et al. (2023) have demonstrated that it aligns with the experimental results in most instances."
  - **Citation:** Leviathan et al. (2023)
  - **Relevance:** This justifies the use of EWIF as a metric for analysis. The citation to Leviathan et al. (2023) provides evidence that EWIF is a valid and useful metric for evaluating speculative decoding.


### 2.7 Experiments

**Summary:** This section describes the experimental setup and results of the CS Drafting algorithm.

- **Claim:** "We select LLAMA-2-chat-7B (Touvron et al., 2023) as our target model."
  - **Citation:** Touvron et al. (2023)
  - **Relevance:** This identifies one of the target models used in the experiments. The citation to Touvron et al. (2023) provides the source for the LLAMA-2 model.

- **Claim:** "Since we do not observe any significant difference between sampling with temperature 1 and greedy decoding in previous speculative decoding experiments (Leviathan et al., 2023), and to ensure our experiments are fully reproducible, we perform sampling at temperature 0, i.e., using greedy decoding by default."
  - **Citation:** Leviathan et al. (2023)
  - **Relevance:** This explains the choice of using greedy decoding in the experiments. The citation to Leviathan et al. (2023) provides context for the decision to use greedy decoding.
