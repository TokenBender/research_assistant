### 2.3 Methodology

**Summary:** This section delves into the core of the ConsistentEE method. It begins by explaining the traditional training objective for early exiting, which uses a weighted sum of cross-entropy losses for all internal classifiers. It then presents the experimental analysis that reveals the limitations of this approach, particularly the unsatisfactory performance of shallow layers. This leads to the introduction of ConsistentEE, which formulates the early exiting process as a reinforcement learning problem. The section details the policy network, reward function, and training process of ConsistentEE.

* **PABEE (Zhou et al., 2020):** A baseline method that highlights the benefits of ConsistentEE's approach.
* **CALM (Schuster et al., 2022):** A baseline method for comparison in the generation tasks.

**Assessment of Literature Integration:**

The paper effectively integrates existing literature to support its claims and findings. It provides a clear overview of the relevant research area, identifies the limitations of existing methods, and justifies the proposed approach with strong arguments and experimental evidence. The authors demonstrate a good understanding of the research landscape and effectively position their work within the broader context of early exiting methods for language models.


I hope this comprehensive analysis is helpful in understanding the paper and its place within the broader research context. Please let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like me to refine any part of the analysis. I'm ready to assist further!
