### 2.1 Introduction

**Summary:** The introduction highlights the widespread adoption of Transformer-based models and their success despite a lack of inherent structural awareness in the core dot-product attention mechanism. It discusses existing ad-hoc approaches to incorporating structural information and emphasizes the need for a more principled and unified framework.
