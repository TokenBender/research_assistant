**4. Experimental Methodology and Its Foundations**

- **Experimental Setup:** The authors use the Mistral-7B-v0.12 language model as the base model. They employ a two-phase approach: SFT (supervised fine-tuning) and preference alignment. During SFT, the model is fine-tuned on datasets of point-wise prompt-response pairs. In the preference alignment phase, the model's text generation policy is refined using datasets with human preference judgments. The hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, training duration) are kept constant across all experiments.
- **Foundations:**
    - The authors don't explicitly cite any specific works as the direct foundation for their experimental setup. However, the two-phase approach (SFT followed by preference alignment) is common in preference learning research, as seen in works like:
        - Ziegler, D. M., Stiennon, N., Wu, J., Brown, T. B., Radford, A., Amodei, D., Christiano, P., & Irving, G. (2019). Fine-tuning language models from human preferences. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1909.08593*.

- **Novel Aspects:** The primary novel aspect is the use of MPO for preference alignment, which eliminates the need for a reward model and reference policy. The authors don't explicitly cite any specific works to justify this novel approach, but it builds upon the existing literature on off-policy reinforcement learning and KL-regularization.
