## 2. Section-by-Section Analysis with Citation Extraction

### 2.1 Introduction

**Summary:** The introduction highlights the limitations of LLMs in handling sequences longer than their pretraining context window, leading to unpredictable behavior due to out-of-distribution (O.O.D.) positional information. It introduces SelfExtend as a solution to extend the context window without fine-tuning, leveraging LLMs' inherent capabilities.

**Significant Citations:**

### 2.3 SelfExtend

**Summary:** This section delves into the core of the paper, presenting the SelfExtend method. It begins by analyzing why LLMs fail on long sequences and then introduces the core idea of mapping unseen relative positions to those seen during pretraining using the FLOOR operation. It also discusses the importance of maintaining standard attention for neighboring tokens.

**Significant Citations:**

- **Claim:** "The behavior of the LLMs becomes unpredictable during inference if the length of a sequence is longer than its pretraining context window length."
  - **Citation:** (Han et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023b)
  - **Relevance:** This citation provides evidence that the problem of LLMs failing on long sequences is a known issue and has been studied previously.

- **Claim:** "We argue that such failure stems from the Out-of-Distribution (O.O.D.) relative distance in the sense that neural networks are not robust to O.O.D. inputs."
