## 4. Experimental Methodology and Its Foundations

- **Experimental Setup:** The authors trained their Camelidae models on a combination of instruction datasets (SlimORCA, Magicoder, and MetaMathQA) and fine-tuned them using the QLORA method. They evaluated the models on a variety of benchmarks, including MMLU, GSM8K, MATH, HumanEval, MBPP, HellaSwag, NaturalQuestions, and TriviaQA.
- **Foundations:**
    - **QLORA (Dettmers et al., 2023):** The authors used QLORA as their primary PEFT method for fine-tuning the models. This choice is justified by QLORA's efficiency and effectiveness in fine-tuning LLMs.
    - **Sparse Upcycling (Komatsuzaki et al., 2023):** The authors leveraged the concept of sparse upcycling to initialize the MoE layers in their sparse models. This approach helps to transfer knowledge from pre-trained dense models to the sparse models.
    - **MoE Architecture (Shazeer et al., 2017; Lepikhin et al., 2020; Du et al., 2022):** The MoE architecture is a core component of the PESC method. The authors cite several works that have explored the use of MoE in LLMs, demonstrating the established nature of this approach.
- **Novel Aspects:**
    - **PESC:** The PESC method itself is a novel contribution, integrating adapters into the MoE layers to allow for expert differentiation without altering the original expert weights. The authors justify this approach by demonstrating its ability to achieve a good approximation of the original sparse upcycling method while using fewer parameters.
    - **Top-2 Gate Router:** While the top-2 gate router is inspired by existing work (Lepikhin et al., 2020; Du et al., 2022), its specific implementation within the PESC framework is novel. The authors justify this choice by highlighting its ability to improve computational efficiency and expert utilization.
