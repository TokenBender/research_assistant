**2. Section-by-Section Analysis with Citation Extraction**

**2.1 Introduction**

* **Key Point:** LLMs are typically limited by fixed context windows, and while fine-tuning can extend them, it's costly and can negatively impact performance on shorter contexts.
    * **Claim:** "Although LLMs can be fine-tuned or retrained to extend their context windows [16; 6; 5; 28; 20; 32; 18], it will result in considerable costs at both training and inference time due to the quadratic computing complexity of self attention. Besides, the continued training on long-sequence data may compromise the LLM's general capability in shorter contexts, which is unfavorable to their practical usage."

* **Key Point:** Activation Beacon condenses LLM activations into compact forms, allowing it to perceive longer contexts within a limited window.
    * **Claim:** "In this work, we propose Activation Beacon (shown as Figure 2) as a new method for LLM's context extension. It condenses the LLM's raw activations (i.e. keys and values from the self-attention module) into highly compact forms such that the LLM can perceive the information from a vast scope of context even with a limited context window."

    * **Relevance:** The authors position Activation Beacon within the broader context of existing techniques like sparse attention and context compression, highlighting its unique approach and potential advantages.


**2.2 Activation Beacon**

* **Key Point:** Activation Beacon leverages the LLM's inherent context representation capabilities to condense activations.
    * **Claim:** "Instead of developing a new model from scratch, we argue that the LLM itself can work as a proficient activation condenser with proper adaptation given its strong and well-established context representation capability."
    * **Citation:** None directly supporting this claim, but the overall argument is built upon the general understanding of LLMs and their self-attention mechanisms.
    * **Relevance:** This claim emphasizes the core idea of Activation Beacon, which is to repurpose the LLM's existing architecture rather than designing a new one.

* **Key Point:** Beacon tokens are introduced to trigger activation condensing.
    * **Claim:** "Particularly, we employ special tokens, called beacon tokens, which prompt the LLM to condense the contextual information into their activations."
    * **Citation:** None directly supporting this specific design choice.
    * **Relevance:** This introduces a key component of the Activation Beacon architecture, demonstrating its novelty.

* **Key Point:** The authors propose a stream processing approach with a sliding window for efficient handling of long contexts.
    * **Claim:** "To efficiently handle long contexts, we propose stream processing with the sliding window. The long context is partitioned into multiple intervals of length l. A sliding window is employed to sequentially process one interval at a time."

    * **Relevance:** This citation acknowledges the related work on streaming language models, highlighting the connection and potential benefits of using a sliding window approach.


**2.3 Stream Processing**

* **Key Point:** The sliding window approach allows for accumulating condensed activations from previous intervals, effectively extending the context.
    * **Claim:** "Different from the typical stream processing where the context beyond the sliding window is discarded [36], our method can accumulatively cover the information from the past (α - 1) × m + n tokens."
    * **Citation:** [36] Xiao, G., Tian, Y., Chen, B., Han, S., and Lewis, M. Efficient streaming language models with attention sinks. arXiv preprint arXiv:2309.17453, 2023.
    * **Relevance:** This emphasizes the novelty of Activation Beacon's approach compared to other streaming methods, highlighting its ability to retain and leverage past contextual information.


**2.4 Learning Method**

* **Key Point:** Activation Beacon is implemented as a plug-in module, minimizing the impact on the original LLM.
    * **Claim:** "Activation Beacon is learned while all of the LLM's original parameters are frozen. Besides, it is only used to generate the condensed activations without interfering the inference process of normal tokens. Therefore, it serves as a plug-in module for the LLM, which introduces the long contextual information without affecting the LLM's existing capabilities in processing short contexts."
    * **Citation:** None directly supporting this specific design choice.
    * **Relevance:** This highlights the compatibility and ease of integration of Activation Beacon with existing LLMs, a key advantage of the proposed method.

* **Key Point:** The authors utilize auto-regression for training Activation Beacon.
    * **Claim:** "We train Activation Beacon by auto-regression, where the next token is predicted based on the condensed activations from the beacon tokens and the raw activations from the ordinary tokens."
    * **Citation:** None directly supporting this specific training approach.
    * **Relevance:** This explains the core training objective and methodology for Activation Beacon.


**3. Experiment**

    * **Relevance:** These citations provide a comprehensive overview of the existing literature on context window extension, setting the stage for the authors to highlight the unique contributions of Activation Beacon.


* **Key Point:** The authors emphasize the advantages of Activation Beacon over existing methods, particularly its compatibility with existing LLMs and its efficiency.
    * **Claim:** "Although such methods can be directly applied to the well-trained LLM, they usually benefit from continual fine-tuning where the extended context can be better utilized [20]. The fine-tuning with long-sequence data is expensive. Thus, people investigate how to reduce the training cost. For example, LongLora [6] proposes S2-Attn and leverages LoRA for cost-effective training; while PoSE [41] uses skip-wise position indices to train LLMs on 2K context length as a simulation of 128K. However, the fine-tuning operations are still prone to big costs if super long-sequence data is presented. Finally, the fine-tuning operation may impair the LLM's existing capabilities on short contexts [20]. By comparison, our method is trained with a small cost and enjoys a high efficiency in training and inference. Besides, it serves as a plug-in module that is fully compatible with the existing LLM."

**5. Experimental Methodology and Its Foundations**

* **Experimental Setup:** The authors use Llama-2-7B as the base model and train Activation Beacon using a mixture of RedPajama and LongAlpaca datasets. They employ a sliding window approach for stream processing and utilize auto-regression for training. The training process involves randomly sampling condensing ratios to enhance generalization.
* **Foundations:** The authors draw inspiration from existing work on streaming language models [36] and context compression techniques [4; 7; 19; 22; 14]. They also leverage the LLM's inherent context representation capabilities as a foundation for their activation condensing approach.

They also extend existing work by demonstrating that a plug-in module can achieve competitive performance with minimal impact on the original LLM. The results also contradict the limitations of other fine-tuning-free methods, which often struggle with longer contexts.
