### 2.3 Automatic Agent Learning via Self-Planning

**Summary:** This section details the process of automatic agent learning within AUTOACT. It describes how the META-AGENT automatically selects tools from the library, synthesizes planning trajectories, and differentiates into specialized sub-agents (PLAN-AGENT, TOOL-AGENT, and REFLECT-AGENT) through a parameter-efficient fine-tuning process. The section also explains the group planning process, where the sub-agents collaborate to solve the task.

**Significant Citations:**

* **Claim:** "Finally, we propose the division-of-labor strategy which resembles cell differentiation based on the self-synthesized trajectories (genes), where the META-AGENT acts as a stem cell (Colman, 2008) and differentiates into three sub-agents with distinct functions: task decomposition, tool invocation, and self-reflection, respectively."
