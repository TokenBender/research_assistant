## 4. Experimental Methodology and Its Foundations

**Experimental Setup:**

The paper evaluates the proposed TOVA compression policy using a variety of long-range tasks, including language modeling, long-range understanding, and text generation. It uses several leading LLMs (LLaMA-2, Mistral, Yi) and their instruction-tuned variants. The experiments involve varying the multi-state size (the number of tokens retained in memory) and comparing the performance of TOVA against baseline compression policies like Window, Window+i, and H2O.

**Foundations in Cited Works:**

* The authors use the standard transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017) as the basis for their experiments.
* The baseline compression policies (Window, Window+i, H2O) are based on prior work (Wang et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2023) that aimed to limit the KV cache size in transformers.
* The long-range tasks are based on established benchmarks like PG-19 (Rae et al., 2020) and ZeroSCROLLS (Shaham et al., 2023).

**Novel Aspects of Methodology:**

* The core novelty lies in the conceptualization of transformers as MSRNNs and the introduction of the TOVA compression policy.
* The authors justify the TOVA approach by connecting it to the concept of bounded MSRNNs and demonstrating its effectiveness through rigorous experimentation.


## 5. Results in Context

**Main Results:**

* TOVA consistently outperforms baseline compression policies in all evaluated tasks.
* TOVA achieves performance comparable to the full (unbounded) model using only a fraction (1/8 to 1/4) of the multi-state size.
* TOVA allows processing significantly longer inputs (up to 70K tokens) compared to the base models.
* The analysis of retained tokens reveals that the first token and certain specific parts-of-speech tags are consistently kept in memory, while recency is not the sole factor determining token retention.

**Comparison with Existing Literature:**

* The results confirm the findings of prior work (Xiao et al., 2023; Han et al., 2023) that retaining a few early tokens can improve performance in long-range tasks.
* TOVA outperforms the Window and H2O policies, which are based on prior work (Wang et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2023), demonstrating its superiority as a compression technique.
* The results extend the understanding of LLMs by showing that they often behave like bounded MSRNNs, even though they are theoretically unbounded.
