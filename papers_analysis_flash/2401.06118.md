    - The authors primarily cite works from the field of LLM compression, with a limited number of citations from other related fields, such as information retrieval and vector quantization.
    - This bias might reflect the authors' focus on LLM compression, but it could also limit the paper's scope and prevent readers from exploring the broader context of the research.

**9. Final Summary:**

- **Contribution to the Field:**
    - The paper makes a significant contribution to the field of LLM compression by introducing AQLM, a novel algorithm that significantly outperforms existing methods, particularly in the extreme compression regime (2-3 bits per parameter).
    - AQLM is the first algorithm to achieve Pareto optimality at less than 3 bits per parameter, demonstrating its ability to maximize accuracy for a given model size.
    - The paper also highlights the practical implications of AQLM, showcasing its efficient GPU and CPU implementations and its ability to match or outperform optimized FP16 implementations for speed while executing in a much smaller memory footprint.
