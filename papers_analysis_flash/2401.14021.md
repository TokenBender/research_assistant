**4. Experimental Methodology and Its Foundations**

- **Experimental Setup:** The paper evaluates RaLMSpec on four QA datasets (Wiki-QA, Web Questions, Natural Questions, TriviaQA) using three language models (GPT2-medium, OPT-1.3B, LLaMA-2-7B) and three retriever types (exact dense, approximate dense, sparse). The baseline is the naive iterative RaLM serving approach (RaLMSeq) as implemented in Ram et al. (2023).
- **Methodology Foundations:**
    - The core methodology of RaLMSpec is based on the concept of speculative execution, which has roots in computer architecture (Burton, 1985).
    - The use of caching for speculative retrieval is a common technique in computer systems.
    - The use of asynchronous verification is inspired by recent work on accelerating LLM serving (Leviathan et al., 2022, Chen et al., 2023).
- **Novel Aspects:**
    - The application of speculative retrieval and batched verification specifically to the context of iterative RaLM is novel.
    - The OS³ (Optimal Speculation Stride Scheduler) is a novel contribution for dynamically adjusting the speculation stride.
    - The authors justify these novel approaches by demonstrating their effectiveness in reducing latency and maintaining generative quality.


**5. Results in Context**

- **Main Results:** RaLMSpec consistently achieves significant speed-up ratios compared to the baseline RaLMSeq across various language models, retrievers, and datasets. The speed-up is most pronounced when using the exact dense retriever. The OS³ scheduler effectively adapts the speculation stride to optimize performance.
- **Comparison with Existing Literature:**
    - The results confirm the findings of prior work that iterative RaLM can achieve better generative quality but suffers from high latency (Khandelwal et al., 2019, Drozdov et al., 2022, Ram et al., 2023).
    - RaLMSpec's performance improvements extend the work of Alon et al. (2022) by guaranteeing the preservation of model output quality while achieving speed-up.
    - The results demonstrate that the proposed techniques (speculative retrieval, batched verification, etc.) are effective in reducing the retrieval overhead, which is a key challenge highlighted in the related work (Khandelwal et al., 2019, Karpukhin et al., 2020).
