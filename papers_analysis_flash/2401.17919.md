### 2.1 Introduction

**Summary:** The introduction highlights the challenge of processing long texts in NLP, particularly with transformer models due to their quadratic complexity in input length. It introduces the concept of sparse attention as a mitigation strategy and then presents state-space models (SSMs) as a low-complexity alternative. Finally, it introduces LOCOST as a novel encoder-decoder architecture leveraging SSMs for long document summarization.
