## 4. Experimental Methodology and Its Foundations

**Experimental Setup:** The authors evaluate their method on various LLM models (LLaMA, Llama-2, Llama-3, and Mistral) using the Wikitext-2 and C4 datasets. They measure perplexity as the primary evaluation metric. They also conduct long context length experiments using the LLaMA-2-7B-32K model and the Longbench benchmark.

**Foundations in Cited Works:**

* **Quantization Methods:** The authors build upon existing work on quantization methods, including uniform quantization [33, 43], non-uniform quantization [8, 16], and dense-and-sparse quantization [16].
* **RoPE:** The authors leverage the rotary positional embedding (RoPE) mechanism, as described in [34], and develop a fused kernel to efficiently apply it after dequantization.
* **Sensitivity Analysis:** The sensitivity-weighted k-means approach for deriving non-uniform quantization signposts is based on the sensitivity analysis framework presented in [28].
* **Sparse Matrix Operations:** The authors utilize efficient sparse matrix operations based on CSR/CSC formats [10, 16] for handling outliers.


**Novel Aspects of Methodology:**

* **Per-Channel Key Quantization:** This is a novel approach to KV cache quantization that addresses the channel-specific outlier patterns observed in Key activations.
* **Pre-RoPE Key Quantization:** This approach mitigates the negative impact of RoPE on quantization accuracy by quantizing Keys before RoPE is applied.
* **nuqX:** This non-uniform quantization method incorporates sensitivity-weighted k-means for signpost placement, leading to more accurate quantization.
* **Per-Vector Dense-and-Sparse Quantization:** This approach adapts dense-and-sparse quantization to the per-channel/per-token nature of KV cache activations, leading to further accuracy improvements.
* **Attention Sink-Aware Quantization:** This technique leverages the observation that the first token often acts as an "attention sink" to further improve accuracy, particularly at lower bit widths.


## 5. Results in Context
