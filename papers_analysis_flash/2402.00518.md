## 4. Experimental Methodology and Its Foundations

**Experimental Setup:** The authors use Llama 2-Chat models of various sizes (7B, 13B, and 70B) as the base LLMs. They augment these models with early-exit layers (MLP, Norm, Layer) at different depths in the Transformer backbone. The training process involves tuning the early-exit layers using standard backpropagation while keeping the original LLM parameters frozen. They evaluate the performance of the early-exit LLMs on various downstream tasks using the HELM metric.

**Foundations:**

* **Transformer Architecture:** Vaswani et al. (2017)
* **GPT Pre-training:** Radford et al. (2018)
* **3D Parallelism:** Shoeybi et al. (2019), Narayanan et al. (2021)
* **Early Exiting:** Graves (2016), Schuster et al. (2021)
* **Knowledge Distillation:** Hinton et al. (2015)

**Novel Aspects:**

* **Two-Stage Tuning:** The authors propose a two-stage procedure for training early-exit LLMs, where the early-exit layers are initialized and then tuned separately. This approach is novel in the context of early-exit LLMs and is justified by the authors' desire to minimize computational cost.
* **Parameter Copying for Initialization:** The authors propose a novel initialization method for the early-exit layers, where parameters are copied from corresponding modules in the original LLM. This approach is motivated by the residual structure of LLMs and aims to accelerate convergence.


## 5. Results in Context

**Main Results:**

* EE-Tuning achieves significant speedup in inference (1.2x to 1.6x) for LLMs of various sizes without a substantial drop in performance on downstream tasks.
* MLP-based early-exit architectures generally achieve the best balance between speed and performance.
* Initializing early-exit layers by copying parameters from the original LLM leads to faster convergence during training.
* EE-Tuning is compatible with 3D parallelism, making it scalable to large LLMs.

**Comparison with Existing Literature:**

* **Confirmation:** The results confirm the findings of prior work on early exiting, demonstrating that it can lead to faster inference without significant performance degradation.
* **Extension:** The authors extend the existing literature by demonstrating the effectiveness of EE-Tuning for large LLMs (up to 70B parameters), which is a previously unexplored scale for early-exit LLMs.
* **Contradiction:** The results contradict the assumption that more complex early-exit architectures always lead to better performance. The authors find that MLP-based architectures often achieve the best balance between speed and performance, even though simpler architectures like Norm achieve lower training losses.
