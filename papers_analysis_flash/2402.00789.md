### 2.7 Node Prioritization Strategy for Non-Sequential Graph Input

- **Key Points:** This subsection explains the node prioritization strategy used in Graph-Mamba to handle non-sequential graph data. It describes how node heuristics are used to sort the input nodes and how this prioritization helps the model to capture long-range dependencies more effectively.

    g. **"The input nodes are then sorted in ascending order by node heuristic such as node degree."**

    c. **"With input batch size B, Mamba reads the O(BLD' +ND') of input A, B, C, and ∆ from HBM, computes the intermediate states of size O(BLD'N) in SRAM and writes the final output of size of O(BLD') to HBM, thus reducing IOs by a factor of N."**
    d. **"Not storing the intermediate states also lowers memory consumption, where intermediate states are recomputed for gradient calculation in the backward pass."**
    e. **"With the GPU-aware implementation of Mamba, GMB achieves linear time complexity (O(L)) to input sequence length, which is significantly faster than the dense attention computation in transformers with quadratic time complexity (O(L2))."**

- **Contribution to the Field:** Graph-Mamba introduces a novel graph neural network architecture that leverages the efficiency of SSMs to achieve effective long-range dependency modeling in graph data. It outperforms existing methods on datasets with long-range dependencies and achieves significant improvements in computational efficiency.
