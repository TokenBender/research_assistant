### 2.1 Introduction

**Summary:** The introduction highlights the increasing popularity of foundation models and the need for efficient adaptation methods. It criticizes existing parameter-efficient methods (like LoRA, adapters, and prompt-tuning) for not significantly reducing training time and memory consumption, as they still require backpropagation through the entire backbone. The authors propose a novel method, Low-Rank Side Adaptation (LoSA), which avoids backpropagation through the backbone and achieves improvements across multiple efficiency metrics.

**Experimental Setup:**

The authors evaluate LoSA on various image and video classification tasks using different vision transformer backbones (ViT-Base, ViT-g, ViT-e, etc.). They compare LoSA to a range of baseline methods, including full fine-tuning, linear probing, LoRA, adapters, prompt-tuning, and LST. The experiments are conducted using the VTAB benchmark, iNaturalist 2018/2021, Places365, and Kinetics 400 datasets. They measure accuracy, training time, memory usage, and inference GFLOPs to assess the efficiency of LoSA.

**Foundations in Cited Works:**
