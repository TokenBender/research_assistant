**2.2 BASE TTS:**

- **Key Points:**
    - BASE TTS is a multi-lingual and multi-speaker LTTS system trained on 100K hours of public domain speech data, doubling the previous highest amount of data used in TTS [17].
    - BASE TTS follows the approach of casting TTS as a next-token-prediction problem [16, 17, 21], inspired by the success of LLMs.
    - The authors aim to improve general TTS quality and study how scaling affects the model's ability to produce appropriate prosody and expression for challenging text inputs, similar to how LLMs acquire new abilities through data and parameter scaling [32, 33].
    - The authors propose an evaluation scheme to assess potential emergent abilities in TTS, identifying seven categories that are challenging from the literature [27–31]: compound nouns, emotions, foreign words, paralinguistics, punctuations, questions, and syntactic complexities.

**2.3 Speechcode Design:**

- **Key Points:**
    - BASE TTS models speech using discrete speech representations called "speechcodes."
    - The authors explore two approaches for speechcode generation:
        - **Autoencoder-based speech tokens:** This approach uses a VQ-VAE trained to reconstruct mel-spectrograms, with a global reference encoder to partially disentangle speaker information [34, 42].
        - **WavLM-based speechcodes:** This approach leverages a pretrained WavLM model [39] and introduces losses to encourage speaker disentanglement and compression with byte-pair encoding [41].
