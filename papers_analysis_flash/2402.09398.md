### 2.1 Introduction

**Summary:** The introduction highlights the increasing computational demands of LLMs, particularly during inference due to the growing size of the KV cache. It emphasizes the trade-off between computational efficiency and memory consumption associated with KV caching. Existing methods, like sparse policies, attempt to reduce the cache size by discarding less important KV pairs, but this can lead to information loss. The authors introduce LESS as a solution to this problem, combining sparse caching with a low-rank cache to retain information efficiently.
