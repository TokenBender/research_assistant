**2.5. Discussion and Related Work:**

- **Significant Citations:**
    - **Claim:** "Our method outperforms all other methods under any desired balance between fidelity and text-adherence."
    - **Citation:** Meng et al., 2021; Song et al., 2021b; Dhariwal & Nichol, 2021; Copet et al., 2023
    - **Relevance:** This claim emphasizes the superiority of the proposed methods in terms of balancing fidelity and text adherence.
    - **Claim:** "We remark that some works use MusicCaps (Agostinelli et al., 2023) to quantitatively evaluate synthesized samples. However, this dataset contains only 10-second long music excerpts, while real music pieces can vary wildly over longer segments, changing instruments, genre or key completely. This aspect is important in the context of text-based editing, where the signal may be a minute long, and the edit should remain consistent across the entire piece (e.g., when changing one instrument into another)."
    - **Citation:** Agostinelli et al., 2023
    - **Relevance:** This citation highlights the limitations of using MusicCaps for evaluating editing performance, emphasizing the need for longer audio excerpts to assess the consistency of edits.
    - **Claim:** "We do not compare to AUDIT (Wang et al., 2023) and InstructME (Han et al., 2023), which train a model specifically for editing purposes, as they did not share their code and trained checkpoints. Additionally, we do not compare to DreamBooth and Textual Inversion as demonstrated on audio by Plitsis et al. (2024), since they solve a different task - that of personalization. This task aims at learning a concept from a reference audio, rather than consistently modifying the input itself."
    - **Citation:** Wang et al., 2023; Han et al., 2023; Plitsis et al., 2024
    - **Relevance:** This citation explains the reasons for not comparing to specific methods, highlighting the differences in their objectives and approaches.
    - **Claim:** "The PCs of the posterior covariance convey the uncertainty of the denoising model at the current timestep. The synthesis process is inherently more uncertain at earlier timesteps in the sampling process (i.e., at larger t). Therefore, the extracted directions {vi|t} generally exhibit more global changes spread over larger segments of the samples for earlier timesteps, and more local changes for later timesteps. Empirically, above a certain timestep the extracted directions are not interesting. We therefore restrict ourselves here to t ≤ 135 (see App. F for further discussion)."
    - **Citation:** Manor & Michaeli, 2024
    - **Relevance:** This citation explains the relationship between the PCs and the uncertainty of the denoising model, highlighting the importance of choosing appropriate timesteps for editing.

We believe it is important to develop methods for automatically detecting whether AI-based methods have been applied to audio signals."
    - **Citation:** None
