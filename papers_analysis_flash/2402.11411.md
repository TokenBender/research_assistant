- Fine-grained analysis reveals that POVID excels in image captioning and detailed description tasks.
- Modality alignment analysis shows that POVID redirects the model's attention towards the image, leading to improved alignment between image and text modalities.


**Comparison with Existing Literature:**

- **Confirmation:** The results confirm the hypothesis that modality alignment is crucial for reducing hallucinations, as suggested by (Cui et al., 2023).
- **Extension:** POVID extends the DPO framework (Rafailov et al., 2023) by introducing a novel approach to generating preference data using AI-generated dispreferred responses.
- **Improvement:** POVID improves upon existing preference tuning methods (Li et al., 2023d; Sun et al., 2023; Yu et al., 2023b) by achieving better performance in reducing hallucinations and improving overall VLLM capabilities.
