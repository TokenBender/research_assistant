### 2.1 Introduction

**Summary:** The introduction highlights the sequential nature of autoregressive (AR) LLMs, which limits parallelism and leads to slow inference. It introduces the concept of semi-autoregressive (SAR) models as a potential solution but notes their drawbacks in terms of output quality and computational cost. The authors then discuss speculative decoding as another acceleration technique and propose their novel approach, SPACE, which combines SAR inference with speculative decoding to achieve lossless speedup.
