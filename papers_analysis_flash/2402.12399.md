In order to achieve a balanced workload across GPUs, top-k routing imposes a maximum limit on the number of tokens that each expert can process. Consequently, any tokens exceeding this limit are dropped, and vacant experts are padded with zeros, which negatively impacts the overall model performance (Gale et al., 2022)."
