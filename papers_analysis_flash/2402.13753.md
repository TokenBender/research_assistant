### 2.1 Introduction

**Summary:** The introduction highlights the desirability of large context windows in LLMs but notes the limitations imposed by high fine-tuning costs, scarcity of long texts, and catastrophic values introduced by new token positions. It establishes the current state-of-the-art context window size (around 128k tokens) and outlines the three key innovations of LongRoPE: identifying and exploiting non-uniformities in positional interpolation, employing a progressive extension strategy, and readjusting LongRoPE for shorter contexts.

## 4. Experimental Methodology and Its Foundations

**Experimental Setup:** The paper evaluates LongRoPE on LLaMA2-7B and Mistral-7B using three tasks: perplexity on long documents, passkey retrieval, and standard LLM benchmarks within a short context window. The experiments involve fine-tuning, evolutionary search for optimal ROPE rescale factors, and performance evaluation across various context lengths.

**Foundations in Cited Works:**

* **Evolutionary Search:** The authors utilize an evolutionary search algorithm (Guo, Z., et al., 2020) to efficiently explore the vast search space for optimal ROPE rescale factors.
* **Fine-tuning:** The fine-tuning process is based on standard practices in the field, with adjustments made to accommodate the extended context lengths.
* **Flash Attention:** The authors leverage Flash Attention-2 (Dao, T., 2023) to accelerate both training and inference, particularly important for handling long sequences.

**Novel Aspects:**

The paper's methodology is novel in its combination of:

* **Exploiting Non-uniformities in RoPE:** Identifying and leveraging the non-uniformities in RoPE dimensions and token positions for positional interpolation.
* **Progressive Extension Strategy:** Utilizing a two-stage process of extending the context window, first to 256k and then to 2048k, with LongRoPE search and fine-tuning.
* **Shorter Context Recovery:** Readjusting the ROPE rescale factors to maintain performance on shorter contexts after extending the window to 2048k.

The authors cite relevant works to justify these novel approaches, particularly in the context of positional interpolation and evolutionary search.


## 5. Results in Context

**Main Results:**
