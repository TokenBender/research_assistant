## 2. Section-by-Section Analysis with Citation Extraction

### 2.1 Introduction

**Summary:** The introduction highlights the challenge of adapting pre-trained language models (LLMs) to specific downstream tasks that involve reward maximization. It contrasts heavier approaches like fine-tuning (e.g., RLHF and supervised finetuning) with lighter methods like few-shot prompting. The authors introduce Q-probing as a lightweight alternative that sits between these extremes and leverages the model's pre-trained capabilities.

**Significant Citations:**

- **Claim:** "One approach to do this is finetuning, where the weights of the model are adjusted to improve rewards. Exemplary techniques include reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF, Ouyang et al., 2022; Rafailov et al., 2023) and supervised finetuning on successful examples (Singh et al., 2023; Dong et al., 2023; Yuan et al., 2023)."

    - **Relevance:** These citations establish the context of existing reward maximization techniques, particularly fine-tuning methods, which Q-probing aims to improve upon.
- **Claim:** "For example, Zaken et al. (2021) propose that extremely parameter-efficient finetuning is evidence that the finetuning process is mostly about “exposing knowledge induced by language-modeling training", while Saunders et al. (2022) find that pre-trained language models are usually better at discriminating than generating answers."

    - **Relevance:** These citations support the idea that LLMs already possess the knowledge needed for many downstream tasks, and that adaptation might primarily involve extracting this knowledge rather than learning entirely new capabilities.

### 2.4 Inference Using Q-Probes

**Summary:** This section details the Q-probe inference procedure, which involves sampling multiple completions from the base LLM, computing their embeddings, and using a linear Q-probe to predict a value for each embedding. This value is then used to reweight the completions and sample the final output.

- Q-probing can be applied to API-based models, although the performance gains might be less pronounced.

**Comparison with Existing Literature:**

- The authors compare their results to various baselines, including few-shot prompting (Min et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2022), fine-tuning (Hu et al., 2021; Singh et al., 2023; Dong et al., 2023), and rejection sampling (Gao et al., 2023; Ganguli et al., 2022; Rafailov et al., 2023).
- Their results demonstrate that Q-probing can outperform these baselines in many cases, particularly when training data is limited.
- The results confirm the hypothesis that aligning the training loss with the inference procedure is crucial for achieving optimal performance (Greensmith et al., 2004; Schulman et al., 2015).
- The results extend the applicability of probing techniques to reward maximization, demonstrating its potential for a wider range of applications.


## 6. Discussion and Related Work

**Situating the Work:**

- The authors position Q-probing as a lightweight alternative to existing reward maximization techniques, such as fine-tuning and prompting.
- They emphasize that Q-probing can be used as a complement to these techniques, potentially leading to further improvements in performance.
- They highlight the connection between Q-probing and the generation-discrimination gap in LLMs (Saunders et al., 2022), suggesting that Q-probing offers a potential path towards closing this gap.
