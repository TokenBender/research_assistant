**Experimental Setup:**

The paper evaluates CoDream on three benchmark datasets (MNIST, SVHN, CIFAR10) using ResNet-18 as the base model architecture. It explores various scenarios, including IID and non-IID data distributions, different numbers of clients, and heterogeneous model architectures. The authors also introduce a faster variant, CoDream-fast, which utilizes a meta-generator for dream initialization.

**Foundations:**

* **DeepDream and DeepInversion:** The knowledge extraction stage of CoDream is based on DeepDream (Mordvintsev et al., 2015) and DeepInversion (Yin et al., 2020).
* **Federated Averaging (FedAvg):** The knowledge aggregation stage of CoDream is inspired by the aggregation process in FedAvg (McMahan et al., 2017).
* **Knowledge Distillation:** The knowledge acquisition stage utilizes knowledge distillation (Hinton et al., 2015) to transfer knowledge from the collaboratively generated dreams to the client models.

**Novel Aspects:**

* **Collaborative Dream Synthesis:** CoDream introduces a novel approach of collaboratively synthesizing dreams across clients, which is a key differentiator from existing KD-based FL methods. The authors do not explicitly cite any specific work justifying this novel approach, but it builds upon the general concept of federated optimization and knowledge distillation.
* **Adaptive Teaching:** The authors introduce an adaptive teaching mechanism where clients act as adaptive teachers for the server, encouraging the generation of dreams that maximize the server's loss. This approach is not directly cited in any specific work but builds upon the general concept of adversarial learning and knowledge distillation.
