    * **Relevance:** This citation establishes the existing challenge that LLMs face when dealing with input sequences longer than their training context, setting the stage for the paper's proposed solution.

* **Claim:** "Recent advances have shown that the long-context ability can be improved by further training a short-context model on long sequences (Touvron et al., 2023; Rozière et al., 2023; The impressive performance of Llama2 (Xiong et al., 2023) and LLaMA-2-7B/13B (Touvron et al., 2023) relies on the original sequence (Rousu et al., 2023) pre-training corpus, limited accessibility of these performance corpora, stands as a testament to this approach. Nevertheless, due to the models often fall short of training when compared to smaller sizes (e.g., B/7B)."
