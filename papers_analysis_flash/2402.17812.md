### 2.1 Introduction

**Summary:** The introduction highlights the advancements in language modeling with the Transformer architecture and the increasing computational costs associated with training large language models. It introduces the concept of instruction tuning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) as alternatives to expensive training from scratch.

### 2.2 Background & Motivation

**Summary:** This section delves into the details of the backpropagation algorithm, explaining its two main phases: forward propagation and backward propagation. It emphasizes the computational cost of both phases, particularly the backward propagation, which involves calculating gradients for both inputs and parameters. The authors highlight that the computational cost of backward propagation is roughly twice that of forward propagation, making it a prime target for optimization. They also discuss the limitations of PEFT methods in reducing computational costs and introduce layer dropping techniques as a potential solution.

### 2.3 Methodology: Dropping Backward Propagation

**Summary:** This section introduces the core idea of DropBP, which focuses on dropping layers during backward propagation while keeping the forward propagation intact. The authors argue that this approach avoids the accuracy degradation observed in traditional layer dropping methods because it doesn't alter the model's output during the forward pass. They also introduce the concept of sensitivity-based drop rate allocation, where the drop rate for each layer is determined by its impact on the training process. This approach aims to stabilize the training process and ensure that the reduction in computational cost doesn't significantly affect accuracy.

### 2.4 Methodology: Sensitivity-based Drop Rate Allocation

**Summary:** This section elaborates on how DropBP determines the drop rate for each layer based on its sensitivity. It explains that sensitivity is calculated as the variance in parameter gradients when a layer's backward propagation is skipped or not. The authors also discuss the memory overhead associated with calculating sensitivity and propose a method to reduce this overhead by using the variance of the L2-norm of parameter gradients instead of the full parameter gradients.

- **SBLD (Zeng et al., 2023)**: This is a more recent layer dropping method that uses sensitivity-based drop rates.
- **Data Parallelism (Li et al., 2020)**, **Tensor Parallelism (Shoeybi et al., 2019)**, **Pipeline Parallelism (Huang et al., 2019)**, **ZeRO (Rajbhandari et al., 2020)**, and **FSDP (Zhao et al., 2023)**: These are cited to highlight the broader context of parallelism techniques in LLM training.

**Highlighting Novelty:**

- The authors emphasize that DropBP is the first method to address the accuracy degradation issue associated with layer dropping by selectively dropping layers during backward propagation.
- They highlight that DropBP achieves significant speedups and memory reductions compared to existing methods, particularly PLD, while maintaining comparable accuracy.
- They also emphasize the compatibility of DropBP with existing PEFT methods, making it a practical and versatile approach for accelerating LLM fine-tuning.


## 7. Future Work and Open Questions

- **Investigating the underlying mechanisms of DropBP's effectiveness:** The authors suggest further research to understand how DropBP efficiently trains deep neural networks.
- **Exploring potential enhancements for DropBP:** The authors acknowledge that there might be further improvements to the DropBP algorithm.
- **Extending DropBP to other deep learning tasks:** The authors suggest exploring the applicability of DropBP to other tasks beyond LLM fine-tuning.

**Citations for Future Work:** (No specific citations are provided for these future directions, but they build upon the existing literature on LLM training and optimization.)


## 8. Critical Analysis of Citation Usage

- **Effectiveness of Citation Usage:** The authors effectively use citations to support their claims and situate their work within the broader research context. They provide relevant citations for key concepts, methods, and comparisons.
- **Areas for Improvement:** While the citation usage is generally strong, a few areas could benefit from additional citations:
    - The discussion of the broader impact of LLMs could benefit from citations to works exploring the societal implications of AI.
    - The discussion of future work could benefit from more specific citations to related research areas.
- **Potential Biases:** The authors primarily cite works related to
