**2. Section-by-Section Analysis with Citation Extraction:**

**2.1 Introduction:**

* **Summary:** The introduction highlights the resource-intensive nature of LLM inference due to the large number of parameters. It argues that not all tasks require the full depth of the model and introduces the concept of AdaInfer, an algorithm designed to adaptively terminate inference based on task complexity.
* **Key Citations:**
    * **Claim:** "Specifically, the inference time complexity for typical large models with a Transformer structure is LSd(d + S) per single inference, where L, S, and d represent the number of layers, sequence length, and hidden size, respectively."
    * **Citation:**  No specific citation is provided for this general complexity formula, but it's a common understanding in the field of Transformer-based models.
    * **Relevance:** This claim establishes the computational cost of LLM inference, motivating the need for optimization strategies like AdaInfer.
    * **Claim:** "Existing solutions to achieve more efficient inference in LLMs include model pruning (Ma et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2024) and sparse models (LeCun et al., 1989; Liu et al., 2023)."

**4. Experimental Methodology and Its Foundations:**

* **Experimental Setup:** The authors conducted experiments on various LLMs (Llama2 series, OPT) across different tasks (question answering, text classification). They evaluated the performance of AdaInfer in zero-shot and few-shot settings, using metrics like accuracy, pruning ratio, and average number of activated layers.
* **Foundations:**
    * **Early Exit (EE):** The authors explicitly draw inspiration from EE techniques used in CNNs/DNNs and BERT, as discussed in the Related Work section.
    * **Classical Classifiers (SVM, CRF):** The authors leverage SVM and CRF as classifiers to predict the optimal layer for stopping inference, relying on the established literature on these methods.
    * **HELM Evaluation:** The authors use the HELM framework (Todd et al., 2024) for evaluating model performance across different tasks.
* **Novel Aspects:**
    * **Instance-wise Inference:** AdaInfer dynamically determines the optimal layer for stopping inference based on the input instance, rather than using a fixed pruning ratio across all instances. This novel approach is not explicitly justified by a specific citation but is a logical extension of the early exit concept.
    * **Logits as Features:** The authors propose using logits as features for the classifier, which is a novel approach for adaptive inference in LLMs. This is not explicitly justified by a specific citation but is motivated by the observation that logits capture the model's prediction confidence.


**5. Results in Context:**

* **Main Results:**
    * AdaInfer achieves an average pruning ratio of 17.8% and up to 43% on sentiment tasks.
    * AdaInfer maintains accuracy within a 1% margin of dense models across various tasks.
    * AdaInfer demonstrates scalability to larger LLMs (Llama2 70B).
    * AdaInfer shows good generalization capabilities across different tasks and models.
* **Comparison with Existing Literature:**
    * **ShortGPT:** The authors compare AdaInfer to ShortGPT, a structured pruning method, and show that AdaInfer achieves better performance and efficiency.
    * **Static Pruning Methods:** The authors contrast AdaInfer with static pruning methods (e.g., GPT pruning) that apply a fixed pruning ratio across all tasks, highlighting the advantage of AdaInfer's adaptive approach.
* **Confirmation, Contradiction, or Extension:**
    * **Confirmation:** The results confirm the findings of previous work on early exit in other neural network architectures, demonstrating that early stopping can be effective in LLMs.
    * **Extension:** The results extend the concept of early exit to decoder-only LLMs, which are the dominant architecture for many large language models.
    * **Contradiction:** The results suggest that deep layers in LLMs may sometimes over-represent certain instances, potentially hindering performance, which contradicts the assumption that deeper layers always lead to better performance.
