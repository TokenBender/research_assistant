        - Language Model
- **Citations:**
    - **Claim:** "We employ SigLIP as the vision encoder to extract high-level semantic feature representations from visual inputs. However, we observe that a single SigLIP encoder struggles to address all real-world questions comprehensively. Vision encoders in the CLIP family, including SigLIP, are primarily designed for semantic visual representations but are challenged by ambiguous encoding, resulting in visually distinct images being encoded as similar due to what is referred to as "CLIP-blind pairs" Tong et al. (2024)."
    - **Citation:** Tong et al. (2024).
    - **Explanation:** This citation highlights the limitations of SigLIP, a vision encoder, in handling ambiguous encoding, citing the concept of "CLIP-blind pairs" introduced by Tong et al. (2024).
