    - **Relevance:** This citation provides the theoretical foundation for the authors' use of perplexity as a metric for evaluating long-context capabilities.

**2.8. Realistic Long-Context Evaluations:**

- **Key Points:** The authors present evaluations of Gemini 1.5 models' ability to perform realistic long-context tasks, such as in-context language learning and long-document question answering. They highlight the model's ability to learn to translate a new language from a single book and answer complex questions about long documents.
- **Significant Citations:**
    - **Claim:** "To test the in-context learning abilities enabled by very long context, we evaluate Gemini 1.5 Flash & 1.5 Pro on the Machine Translation from One Book (MTOB) benchmark (Tanzer et al., 2023). MTOB measures the ability to learn to perform sentence-level translation between English and Kalamang (ISO 639-3 language code: kgv) from instructional materials. Kalamang has fewer than 200 speakers and therefore virtually no presence on the web, which means that the model must rely on the data given in context (rather than knowledge stored in its weights at training time)."

    - **Relevance:** This citation introduces the MTOB benchmark, which is specifically designed to evaluate in-context language learning capabilities for low-resource languages.

**2.9. Scaling In-Context Learning for Low-Resource Machine Translation:**

- **Key Points:** The authors explore the scaling of in-context learning (ICL) for low-resource machine translation, demonstrating Gemini 1.5 models' ability to improve translation performance with increasing numbers of in-context examples. They compare Gemini 1.5 models' performance to GPT-4 Turbo, highlighting the significant improvement in translation quality with more in-context examples.
- **Significant Citations:**
    - **Claim:** "The impressive in-context language learning capability of Gemini 1.5 inspires us to revisit traditional in-context learning (ICL) at scale. ICL allows LLMs to learn new tasks from input-output examples provided at inference time. While it has been widely observed across tasks and models, the number of in-context examples explored is often limited, ranging from a handful to a few dozen, because of context length limitations and/or suboptimal long-context capabilities (Brown et al., 2020; Min et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2023a). By contrast, Gemini 1.5’s millions of tokens of context open new opportunities for scaling ICL to thousands of examples, also known as the many-shot ICL regime (Agarwal et al., 2024a; Bertsch et al., 2024). In this section, we explore to what extent Gemini 1.5 can leverage an increased number of in-context examples (or shots) to improve machine translation for low-resource languages, extending the prior work exploring the limits of few-shot learning for machine translation (Garcia et al., 2023)."

    - **Relevance:** This citation highlights the authors' contribution to the field of in-context learning, particularly in the context of low-resource machine translation.

**2.10. Long-Document QA:**

- **Key Points:** The authors evaluate Gemini 1.5 Pro's ability to answer questions about long documents, comparing its performance to Gemini 1.0 Pro. They highlight the model's ability to handle long documents without relying on external retrieval methods, demonstrating a significant improvement in question answering capabilities.
- **Significant Citations:**
    - **Claim:** "Generally, LLMs today can achieve high factual accuracy in the zero-shot setting for well-known works such as “Les Misérables”. This makes it challenging to distinguish between models when using absolute performance measures. We therefore use side-by-side comparisons to assess the answer quality between models with varying context sizes. For a more detailed discussion on this methodology and its implications, see (Bohnet et al., 2024). The side-by-side comparison allows us to rate if models provide enough details to answer a question sufficiently. We use an auto-rater that takes a question and answers from two different systems and compares them against each other. The auto-rater response is either system-A is better, system-B is better or None if both answers are non-factual, in which case they are both excluded."

    - **Relevance:** This citation introduces the side-by-side comparison methodology, which is used to evaluate the quality of model responses in a more nuanced way.

**2.11. Long-Context Audio:**

- **Key Points:** The authors evaluate Gemini 1.5 models' ability to handle long-context audio inputs, comparing their performance to existing models like Whisper and the Universal Speech Model (USM). They highlight Gemini 1.5 Pro's ability to transcribe 15-minute audio segments without requiring segmentation, demonstrating a significant improvement in speech recognition capabilities.
- **Significant Citations:**
    - **Claim:** "The Table 8 below shows that the 1.0 Pro model, when evaluated on transcribing 15-minute videos without segmentation, has a WER of 100% due to a mismatch between training and testing audio lengths. When we segment the videos every 30 seconds and pass the textual content of the language model across each segment boundary, the 1.0 Pro model can achieve a WER of 7.8%. The USM model with a CTC decoder, while robust to long segments, achieves a WER of 8.8%. As indicated in the table, Whisper is not robust to long segments and hence requires audio to be segmented every 30 seconds to achieve a WER of 7.3%. In comparison, Gemini 1.5 Pro is much more robust on these longer-context tasks. Specifically, thanks to its long-context capabilities and without the added complexity of extra input segmentation and pre-processing, Gemini 1.5 Pro can transcribe 15-minute videos more accurately than other models, achieving a WER of 5.5%, while Gemini 1.5 Flash trailing behind 1.0 Pro with a WER of 8.8%, a remarkable level of quality considering its smaller size and superier efficiency."

- **Significant Citations:**
    - **Claim:** "Unfortunately, no existing benchmarks satisfy these properties for evaluating models that can handle hours-long videos like Gemini 1.5 models. The publicly available question answering benchmark with the longest videos is EgoSchema (Mangalam et al., 2023), but its videos are at most 3 minutes (i.e., 180 frames) in length. To bridge this evaluation gap, we introduce a new benchmark, 1H-VideoQA, composed of 125 five-way multiple-choice questions over public videos 40-105 minutes long."

They highlight the model's ability to solve planning problems with fewer examples and demonstrate its effectiveness in both classical and natural language planning tasks.
- **Significant Citations:**
    - **Claim:** "We evaluate the planning capability of the model as we add more examples (“shots") into the context, inspired by the success of many-shot learning across a large number of tasks (Agarwal et al., 2024a). The challenge in “in-context planning" involves understanding a specific task and problem through a limited number of examples. Additionally, it requires the models to produce a solution without checking each planning step to confirm if a proposed move is correct. The model has to create a plan in one go. To humans, this might be seen as thinking fast (instead of slow)."

They demonstrate Gemini 1.5 Pro's ability to extract information from images and output it in a structured format, highlighting the model's performance compared to GPT-4 Turbo and Claude 3 Opus.
- **Significant Citations:**
    - **Claim:** "As an instance of unstructured data analytics, we perform an image structuralization task. We present LLMs with a set of 1024 images with the goal of extracting the information that the images contain into a structured data sheet (see Appendix 12.7 for examples prompts used in this study). As this is a long-context task, in case where context length of models does not permit processing of all the images at once, we use mini-batches with different batch sizes to alleviate this shortcoming. In the end, the results of each mini-batch are concatenated to form the final structured table."
    - **Citation:** None.
    - **Relevance:** This claim is supported by the figure presented in the paper, which visually demonstrates Gemini 1.5 Pro's capabilities in image structuralization.

    - **Claim:** "With web-scale pretraining of langauge models, decontamination of public benchmarks is a persis tant challenge (Brown et al., 2020; Gemini-Team et al., 2023; OpenAI, 2023a). Gemini 1.5 employed standard n-gram based decontamination procedures to help mitigate this issue, however these n-gram based procedures are imperfect. To move beyond the reliance on training set decontamination, we also report performance on a internally developed non-public evals, such as PhysicsFinals, HiddenMath, and Natural2Code."

- **Significant Citations:**
    - **Claim:** "Results are shown on Table 21. We find that this approach advances state-of-the-art performance consistently across all mathematical benchmarks. Our math-specialized model achieves an accuracy of 80.6% on the MATH benchmark from a single sample, and an accuracy of 91.1% when sampling 256 solutions and selecting a candidate answer (rm@256). This performance is achieved without code execution, theorem proving libraries, Google Search or other tools. This performance is on par with a human-expert performance (Hendrycks et al., 2021b). We find the math-specialized Gemini 1.5 Pro demonstrates generally improved mathematical performance beyond MATH, solving 4x more problems from AIME, and demonstrates significant improvement in Math Odyssey, HiddenMath and IMO-Bench."

They discuss the potential applications of Flash-8B, such as large-scale data labeling, high-throughput agent serving, and model integration in complex workflows.
- **Significant Citations:**
    - **Claim:** "While Flash-8B’s smaller form factor necessarily leads to a reduction in quality compared to Flash and 1.5 Pro, it unlocks substantial benefits, particularly in terms of high throughput and extremely low latency. This translates to affordable and timely large-scale multimodal deployments, facilitating novel use cases previously deemed infeasible due to resource constraints. Examples of such use cases include:"

Current benchmarks often fail to adequately stress-test models like those in Gemini 1.5 series, as they are typically designed for evaluating shorter context models. As the evaluation requirements for frontier models increasingly require benchmarks with both length and complexity, the task of human labeling and annotation will become significantly more costly and time-consuming. This additionally challenges traditional evaluation methods that rely heavily on manual evaluation."
