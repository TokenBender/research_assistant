### 2.1 Introduction

**Summary:** The introduction highlights the impressive performance of LLMs across various tasks, including code generation, math problem solving, and multilingual capabilities. It also emphasizes the challenges of scaling LLM training due to the high computational cost and vulnerability to hardware failures in synchronized training. The authors then introduce the Branch-Train-Merge (BTM) method as a step towards more efficient training but point out its limitations in terms of unified model finetuning. Finally, they introduce the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) approach as another method for reducing computational cost and mention its limitations in terms of asynchronous training.

### 2.3 Branch-Train-MiX

**Summary:** This section details the proposed Branch-Train-MiX (BTX) method, which consists of three stages: Branch, Train, and Mix. The Branch stage involves creating multiple copies of a seed LLM. The Train stage entails training these copies independently on different datasets corresponding to specific domains. The Mix stage combines the feedforward layers of the expert LLMs into a single MoE model and averages the remaining parameters, followed by MoE finetuning.

**Significant Citations:**

* **Claim:** "After all the expert training is finished, we will end up with N different LLMs, with each specializing in a specific distribution.

## 4. Experimental Methodology and Its Foundations

**Experimental Setup:**

The authors use LLAMA-2 7B as the seed model and create three copies of it, training each copy on a different dataset corresponding to a specific domain (Math, Code, Wikipedia). They also include the original LLAMA-2 7B as a "generalist" expert. The training process is embarrassingly parallel, with each expert model trained independently. After training, the feedforward layers of the expert models are combined into a single MoE model, and the remaining parameters are averaged. The resulting model is then finetuned on a combined dataset.

**Foundations in Cited Works:**

* **Branch-Train-Merge (BTM):** The authors explicitly cite Li et al. (2022a) and Gururangan et al. (2023) as the basis for the Branch and Train stages of their methodology. BTM serves as a starting point, and BTX extends it by incorporating MoE.

**Novel Aspects of Methodology:**

The main novelty of the BTX method lies in its integration of MoE within the Transformer layers and the subsequent finetuning of the combined MoE model. This approach allows for a more fine-grained mixing of expert knowledge and enables the model to learn optimal routing decisions. The authors justify this novel approach by highlighting the limitations of simply averaging the outputs of expert models, as done in BTM.


## 5. Results in Context

**Main Results:**

- BTX achieves better overall performance than various baselines, including LLAMA-2 13B, Dense, Sparse Upcycling, and BTM.
- Expert models trained on specific domains show significant improvements in those domains.
- BTX maintains performance on general tasks while improving performance on specialized tasks.
- BTX is more compute-efficient than other methods, achieving higher training throughput.

**Comparison with Existing Literature:**

- **Confirmation:** The results confirm the findings of previous work on the effectiveness of specialized models (Li et al., 2022a; Gururangan et al., 2023) and MoE techniques (Jiang et al., 2024; Shazeer et al., 2017).
- **Extension:** The results extend the existing literature by demonstrating that integrating MoE within the Transformer layers and finetuning the combined model can lead to further improvements in performance and compute efficiency.
- **Contradiction:** The results partially contradict the findings of Jiang et al. (2024), who observed that MoE experts don't naturally specialize in specific domains. BTX, with its explicit tying of experts to domains, shows that specialization can be achieved.
