### 2.1 Problem

- **Key Point:** SMoEs have gained popularity for scaling large and small models, particularly with applications in Universal Transformers and continual learning.
    - **Claim:** "Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMoEs; Shazeer et al. 2017) have become increasingly popular. While applications like Switch Transformer (Fedus et al., 2022) use SMoEs to scale 'outrageously' large models by distributed computing, it has proven useful in scaling up smaller models where device memory is an issue. Coupled with SMoE versions of the attention module (Zhang et al., 2022; Csordás et al., 2023), SMoEs have been used to scale up Universal Transformers (Dehghani et al., 2018; Tan et al., 2023), and also for applications to continual learning in a fully modularised Transformer (Shen et al., 2023)."

    - **Relevance:** This section establishes the context and importance of SMoEs within the field of deep learning, highlighting their use in various applications and their growing relevance for scaling model size and performance.


- **Key Point:** Naive implementations of SMoEs in PyTorch are slow and inefficient on GPUs, leading to issues with expert imbalance and memory allocation.
    - **Claim:** "SMoEs are challenging to implement efficiently. While a lot of deep learning research is implemented in PyTorch (Paszke et al., 2019), the naive implementation of SMoEs are too slow, and do not take full advantage of the parallelism of GPUs. Further, initial implementations on TPUs require all tensor sizes to be known statically (at compilation time). This creates issues when experts are imbalanced: some experts are used a lot, exceeding the capacity decided at compilation time, requiring dropping of some tokens. On the other hand, underused experts are padded, which creates unnecessary memory allocation."
    - **Citation:** Paszke et al., 2019. "PyTorch: An imperative style, high-performance deep learning library." *Advances in neural information processing systems*, 32.
    - **Relevance:** This highlights the challenges associated with existing SMoE implementations, particularly the limitations of naive approaches in terms of speed and efficiency on GPUs, setting the stage for the proposed ScatterMoE solution.


- **Key Point:** Megablocks and PIT address the SMoE problem by framing it as a sparse matrix multiplication problem, leading to more efficient GPU implementations.
    - **Claim:** "To combat this, Megablocks (Gale et al., 2023) and PIT (Zheng et al., 2023) frames the SMoE computation as a sparse matrix multiplication problem. This then allowed the problem to be broken down into a block sparse matrix multiplication problme, which could then be computed efficiently. In both these cases, the authors were able to create a more efficient GPU-based implementation of SMoEs."

    - **Relevance:** This introduces the prior work that inspired ScatterMoE, showing how existing approaches attempted to improve SMoE efficiency by leveraging sparse matrix operations.


- **Key Point:** Existing SMoE implementations still have room for improvement, particularly in terms of memory overhead due to initial data copying and padding.
    - **Claim:** "However, these existing implementations still leave room for possible improvement. Firstly, existing implementations of SMoEs, performs a scatter-to-group initial copy of the input, creating a memory allocation and memory footprint overhead during training because of stored tensors used in the backward pass. Some implementations like Megablocks further pad the grouped copy so they are of equal sized blocks, which further increases the memory overhead."
    - **Citation:** (No direct citation for this specific claim, but it builds upon the previously mentioned limitations of Megablocks and other implementations.)
    - **Relevance:** This section identifies the specific limitations of existing approaches that ScatterMoE aims to address, emphasizing the need for a more memory-efficient solution.


### 2.2 Sparse Mixture-of-Experts

- **Key Point:** The naive method of computing SMoE outputs by iterating over tokens is inefficient.
    - **Claim:** "SMOE modules are made up of E experts which are typically sub-modules of a similar architecture. Each of the T tokens in the input is routed via a routing module, and then based on its output weights, assigned to k experts, where k ≤ E. However, the naive method of computing the output of an SMoE (iterating over all tokens and evaluating the respective expert output) is far too slow, and does not exploit the full parallelism of GPU computation."
    - **Citation:** (No direct citation for this specific claim, but it's a common understanding in the field of SMoE implementations.)
    - **Relevance:** This section explains the basic SMoE architecture and highlights the inefficiency of a straightforward approach, setting the stage for the introduction of ScatterMoE's optimized approach.


### 2.3 ParallelLinear Operation

- **Key Point:** ParallelLinear is a core component of ScatterMoE that allows for fused grouped and scattered operations, reducing memory overhead.
    - **Claim:** "Our implementation of SMoE relies on ParallelLinear, which allows for different combinations of grouped General Matrix Multiplications (GeMMs). In order to achieve this, we wrote a Triton kernel, scatter2scatter, that enables all combinations of operations shown in Figure 2. This operation fuses grouped GeMMs and scattered read and write operations, which allows us to skip an intermediate group and copy step."
    - **Citation:** Tillet et al., 2019. "Triton: an intermediate language and compiler for tiled neural network computations." *Proceedings of the 3rd ACM SIGPLAN International Workshop on Machine Learning and Programming Languages*, pp. 10–19.
    - **Relevance:** This introduces the core innovation of ScatterMoE, the ParallelLinear operation, which is implemented using Triton and enables the fusion of operations, leading to reduced memory usage and improved efficiency.


- **Key Point:** ParallelLinear allows for different combinations of grouped and scattered operations, enabling efficient forward and backward passes.
    - **Claim:** "ParallelLinear allows options for grouped and scattered for both input and output, resulting in the four possible combinations seein in Figure 2. With combinations of these operations, we can implement both the forward and backward passes of ParallelLinear."
    - **Citation:** (No direct citation for this specific claim, but it's a direct consequence of the ParallelLinear design.)
    - **Relevance:** This explains how the flexibility of ParallelLinear allows for efficient implementation of both the forward and backward passes of the SMoE model.


### 2.4 SMoE Multi-layer Perceptron (SMoE MLP)

- **Key Point:** ScatterMoE can reduce the memory footprint of SMoE MLPs by carefully configuring ParallelLinear operations.
    - **Claim:** "In the context of an SMoE MLP, we can reduce the memory footprint even further. The MLP requires two linear transformations, and could be naively implemented with two ParallelLinear operations set to perform scatter-to-scatter transformations. However, we can configure these two linear transforms to be scattered-to-grouped then grouped-to-scattered respectively. This means that for each ParallelLinear transform in the SMOE MLP, only one group operation would be required."
    - **Citation:** (No direct citation for this specific claim, but it's a direct consequence of the ParallelLinear design and the SMoE MLP architecture.)
    - **Relevance:** This section demonstrates how ScatterMoE can be specifically applied to the common SMoE MLP architecture to further optimize memory usage.


### 2.5 Extensibility: Mixture-of-Attention (MoA)

- **Key Point:** ScatterMoE can be extended to implement Mixture-of-Attention (MoA) efficiently without incurring additional memory overhead.
    - **Claim:** "ScatterMoE provides an advantage. Since we can retain the scattered ordering through a ParallelLinear transform, we can implement MoAs without allocating the extra arrays for grouping and scattering. Figure 3 shows the operations used for SMoE Attention."
    - **Citation:** Tan et al., 2023. "Sparse universal transformer." *arXiv preprint arXiv:2310.07096*.
    - **Relevance:** This section demonstrates the flexibility of ScatterMoE by showing how it can be extended to implement a different type of expert module (MoA), highlighting its potential for broader applications beyond standard MLP experts.
