### 2.1 Introduction

**Summary:** The introduction highlights the importance of deep features in computer vision, particularly for downstream tasks like semantic segmentation and depth estimation. However, it notes that these features often lack spatial resolution due to aggressive pooling operations in model architectures. The paper introduces FeatUp, a task- and model-agnostic framework to address this issue by restoring lost spatial information. Two variants of FeatUp are presented: one using a single forward pass and another employing an implicit model for per-image feature reconstruction.
