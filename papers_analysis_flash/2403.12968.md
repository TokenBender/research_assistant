* **Claim:** "To extract knowledge from the LLM for effective prompt compression, our goal is to prompt GPT-4 to generate compressed texts from original texts that meet the following criteria: (i) Token reduction: Compressed prompts should be short in length to reduce cost and speed up inference. (ii) Informativeness: Essential information should be retained. (iii) Faithfulness: Compressed prompts should remain faithful and avoid introducing hallucinated content to ensure accuracy when prompting LLMs in downstream tasks."
