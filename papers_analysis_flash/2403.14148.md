**Situating the Work:**

The authors situate their work within the context of existing video generation methods, particularly those that leverage pretrained image diffusion models or motion-content decomposition. They highlight the limitations of previous approaches, such as high computational costs and the inability to effectively utilize pretrained models.

**Key Papers Cited:**

-   **PVDM (Yu et al., 2023b):** The authors compare CMD to PVDM, highlighting the differences in their latent space design and focus on conditional vs. unconditional video generation.
-   **VideoFusion (Luo et al., 2023):** The authors discuss the similarities and differences between CMD and VideoFusion, emphasizing CMD's focus on efficiency through dimension reduction.
-   **Show-1 (Zhang et al., 2023):** The authors acknowledge the concurrent work of Show-1, which also explores efficient text-to-video generation using a mixture of diffusion models.
-   **LAVIE (Wang et al., 2023c):** The authors mention LAVIE as a concurrent work that uses cascaded latent diffusion models for video generation.
-   **VideoDirectorGPT (Lin et al., 2023):** The authors briefly discuss VideoDirectorGPT, which uses large language models to generate text prompts for video generation.

**Highlighting Novelty:**

The authors use these citations to emphasize the novelty of CMD in several aspects:

-   **Efficient Latent Space Design:** CMD's content-frame and motion latent decomposition leads to a more efficient latent space compared to PVDM and other latent video diffusion models.
-   **Direct Pretrained Model Integration:** CMD's direct use of pretrained image diffusion models for content frame generation is a novel approach that improves both quality and efficiency, differentiating it from VideoFusion and other methods.
-   **Focus on Conditional Generation:** CMD's primary focus on conditional video generation, particularly text-to-video generation, distinguishes it from methods like PVDM that primarily focus on unconditional generation.
