    - Jamba's results confirm the potential benefits of MoE in scaling language models [14, 46].
    - Jamba's results extend the exploration of hybrid architectures combining attention and SSMs [17, 39], demonstrating their effectiveness at a larger scale and in production-grade settings.
    - Jamba's results suggest that Mamba models may have limitations in in-context learning [35], which is addressed by the hybrid architecture.


## 6. Discussion and Related Work

- **Situating the Work:** The authors situate their work within the broader context of LLM research, highlighting the limitations of existing architectures (Transformers, RNNs) and the potential benefits of SSMs like Mamba. They discuss related work on hybrid architectures, emphasizing the novelty of Jamba's approach in terms of architecture, scale, and performance.
- **Key Papers Cited:**
    - [14, 17, 35, 39, 46, 51] (MoE, Mamba, Induction Heads, Hyena, Transformer)
    - [24, 50] (Mixtral, Llama-2)
- **Highlighting Novelty:**
    - The authors use citations to demonstrate that Jamba addresses the limitations of existing architectures, particularly in terms of memory usage, throughput, and long-context capabilities.
    - They highlight the novelty of Jamba's hybrid architecture and its ability to achieve a balance between these conflicting objectives.
    - They also use citations to differentiate Jamba from related work on hybrid architectures, emphasizing its larger scale and production-grade implementation.

## 8. Critical Analysis of Citation Usage

- **Effectiveness:** The authors generally use citations effectively to support their claims and findings. They provide a good overview of the relevant literature and clearly situate their work within the broader research context.
- **Areas for Improvement:**
    - While the authors cite a wide range of relevant works, they could have provided more specific citations in some sections, particularly when discussing general concepts or trends in the field.
    - For example, in the introduction, they could have provided more specific citations to support the claims about the limitations of Transformers and RNNs.
- **Potential Biases:**
    - The authors primarily cite works from the deep learning and NLP communities, which is appropriate given the focus of the paper.
    - There is a slight over-reliance on works from Google AI and Meta AI, which is understandable given the prominence of these organizations in the field. However, they also cite a diverse range of other works from academia and industry.


## 9. Final Summary

- **Contribution:** Jamba represents a significant contribution to the field of LLMs by introducing a novel hybrid architecture that combines the strengths of Transformer and Mamba layers with MoE. It achieves state-of
