## 2. Section-by-Section Analysis with Citation Extraction

### 2.1 Introduction

**Summary:** The introduction highlights the growing importance of LLMs and the challenges associated with their inference due to high computational and memory demands. It introduces the concept of quantization as a solution to these issues and emphasizes the difficulty of quantizing activations due to outlier features.

**Significant Citations:**

- **Claim:** "Quantization is among the most important techniques to solve both memory and compute issues during LLM inference. Joint quantization aims to reduce the precision of parameters and KV cache (which results in lower memory usage) as well as inputs (known as activations) and compute the forward pass in low precision."
- **Citation:**  [Frantar et al., 2022] Frantar, E., Ashkboos, S., Hoefler, T., & Alistarh, D. (2022). GPTQ: Accurate post-training quantization for generative pre-trained transformers. *arXiv preprint arXiv:2210.17323*.
- **Explanation:** This citation establishes the importance of quantization in LLM inference and introduces the concept of joint quantization, which is a key aspect of the QuaRot method.

- **Claim:** "Quantizing the activations is hard as they have large outlier elements (see Figure 1 for an illustrative example) with much larger values, making activation quantization more difficult than weight quantization, especially for the 4-bit case. Previous work relies on characterizing outlier features using a calibration set and keeping them in higher precision during the inference."
