### 2.2.1 Memory Consumption Analysis

- **Key Points:** Analyzes the memory requirements of BAdam and compares it with Adam, LOMO, and LoRA. Shows how BAdam significantly reduces memory consumption by partitioning the model parameters.
- **Significant Citations:**

    a. "Let us consider a large language model with M billion parameters. We will use GB as the unit of GPU memory in the sequel."
    b. "In terms of BAdam, it needs to store the up-to-date model parameters (see Figure 1) in FP16 precision, which costs 2M memory. Importantly, since BAdam only updates the active block at one time, we can store the model parameters, gradient, momentum, and second moment only for the active block θπ₁ in FP32 precision, where the FP32 model parameters and gradient of the active block can be obtained by transforming their FP16 versions to the FP32 versions."

Furthermore, gradient checkpointing [11] can be employed to reduce the memory requirement needed for storing activations."
