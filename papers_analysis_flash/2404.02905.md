### 3. Method

**Summary:** This section details the proposed VAR model. It starts by discussing the limitations of traditional autoregressive models for image generation, including the violation of the unidirectional dependency assumption, inability to perform certain zero-shot tasks, structural degradation, and inefficiency. Then, it introduces the VAR framework, which redefines autoregressive learning as "next-scale prediction" instead of "next-token prediction." The section also describes the multi-scale VQ tokenizer and the VAR transformer architecture.

**Significant Citations:**

* **Claim:** "In quantized autoencoders (VQVAEs), the encoder typically produces an image feature map f with inter-dependent feature vectors f(i,j) for all i, j. So after quantization and flattening, the token sequence (x1, x2,..., Xhxw) retains bidirectional correlations."

* **Claim:** "The image tokens in q ∈ [V]h×w are arranged in a 2D grid. Unlike natural language sentences with an inherent left-to-right ordering, the order of image tokens must be explicitly defined for unidirectional autoregressive learning. Previous AR methods [30, 92, 50] flatten the 2D grid of q into a 1D sequence x = (x1,...,xhxw) using some strategy such as row-major raster scan, spiral, or z-curve order."
