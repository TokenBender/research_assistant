**Experimental Setup:** The paper evaluates superposition prompting on three families of LLMs (OpenELM, BLOOMZ, and MPT) using the NaturalQuestions-Open and MuSiQue datasets. It compares the proposed method to various baselines, including Naive LLM-RAG, BM-25, TF-IDF, Contriever, Attention Sort, and Prompt Cache. The experiments involve measuring both the speed and accuracy of the different methods.

**Foundations in Cited Works:**

* **RAG:** The paper builds upon the foundational work on RAG (Lewis et al., 2020) and its various implementations (Guu et al., 2020, Borgeaud et al., 2021b, Gao et al., 2023, Asai et al., 2023).
* **Long Context Processing:** The paper leverages existing work on efficient long context processing techniques, such as KV-caching (Sheng et al., 2023, Lin et al., 2023, Xiao et al., 2022) and specialized transformer architectures like Longformer (Beltagy et al., 2020) and Reformer (Kitaev et al., 2020).
* **Prompt Engineering:** The paper draws inspiration from prompt engineering research (Bubeck et al., 2023, Liu et al., 2023b) and the concept of "golden document" location (Liu et al., 2023a).
* **Path Integral Analogy:** The paper's conceptual framework is inspired by the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics (Feynman, 1965).

**Novel Aspects of Methodology:**

* **Superposition Prompting:** The core novelty lies in the introduction of superposition prompting, which structures the prompt as a DAG and allows for parallel processing of different context paths. The authors cite Feynman (1965) for the conceptual inspiration.
* **Path Pruning:** The authors introduce a novel path pruning mechanism based on a Bayesian saliency score to discard irrelevant context paths, improving efficiency and accuracy. They cite Muennighoff (2022) for the inspiration behind the saliency score calculation.
* **Path Caching and Parallelization:** The authors propose path caching and parallelization techniques that leverage the DAG structure for further efficiency gains. They cite Kwon et al. (2023) for the inspiration behind path caching.


## 5. Results in Context

**Main Results:**

* **Significant Speedup:** Superposition prompting achieves a substantial reduction in compute time compared to baselines, particularly for larger LLMs and longer contexts. For example, on the NaturalQuestions-Open dataset with the MPT-7B instruction-tuned model, it achieves a 93× reduction in compute time while improving accuracy by 43%.
* **Improved Accuracy:** Superposition prompting generally leads to higher accuracy compared to baselines, particularly on the NaturalQuestions-Open dataset. It achieves improvements of 12-43% over the naive solution and up to 15% over the next best competitor.
* **Robustness Across LLMs:** The improvements are observed across different families of LLMs (OpenELM, BLOOMZ, and MPT), suggesting the generalizability of the proposed method.
* **Sensitivity to Positional Encoding:** The authors find that superposition prompting is particularly well-suited for LLMs that use continuous-valued token position assignments, such as those using RoPE.

**Comparison with Existing Literature:**

* **Confirmation:** The results confirm the findings of previous work on the "distraction phenomenon" (Liu et al., 2023a, Shi et al., 2023) and the limitations of LLMs in handling long sequences (Press et al., 2021, Ruoss et al., 2023).
* **Contradiction:** The results contradict the assumption that simply caching document KVs would be sufficient for achieving significant speedups in RAG (Gim et al., 2023).
* **Extension:** The results extend the work on efficient long context processing (Sheng et al., 2023, Lin et al., 2023, Xiao et al., 2022) by demonstrating that superposition prompting can achieve substantial speedups without requiring major architectural changes or re-training.
