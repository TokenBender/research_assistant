## 4. Experimental Methodology and Its Foundations

**Experimental Setup:**

* **Models:** The authors utilize pre-trained Flan-PaLM models of sizes 1B, 8B, and 24B.
* **Fine-tuning:** They fine-tune these models with the TransformerFAM and TransformerBSWA architectures for an additional 50k steps using instruction data packed into 8.5k tokens.
* **Tasks:** They evaluate the models on various long-context tasks (LCTs) like NarrativeQA, ScrollsQasper, Scrolls-Quality, and XLSum, as well as GPT-3 tasks.
* **Optimization:** They use the Adafactor optimizer with specific learning rates for each model size.
* **LoRA:** They employ LoRA for parameter-efficient fine-tuning.

**Foundations:**

* **Longformer [35]:** The authors build upon the Longformer's block-wise caching mechanism in their BSWA implementation.
* **TransformerXL [26]:** The authors discuss the "stop gradient" technique used in TransformerXL for memory segments and argue against its negative impact on receptive field.
* **Wav2vec 2.0 [41]:** The authors explore the use of diversity loss, inspired by Wav2vec 2.0, to encourage uniform attention across inputs.
* **Compressive Transformers [21]:** The authors discuss the concept of reconstruction loss used in compressive transformers and explain why they don't use it in their approach.


**Novel Aspects:**

* **FAM Architecture:** The core novelty lies in the FAM architecture, which introduces a feedback loop that allows the Transformer to attend to its own latent representations, effectively creating working memory. The authors justify this novel approach by drawing inspiration from biological neural networks and the success of RNNs in incorporating feedback loops.
* **Random Position Offset:** To address the input length extrapolation problem, the authors introduce a random position offset during training, which helps the model generalize to longer sequences.

**Main Results:**

* **Improved Performance on Long-Context Tasks:** TransformerFAM significantly outperforms TransformerBSWA on various long-context tasks, demonstrating its ability to effectively compress and retain important contextual information.
* **Scalability with Model Size:** The performance improvements of TransformerFAM are observed across different model sizes (1B, 8B, and 24B), indicating that the FAM mechanism scales well.
* **Marginal Improvement on GPT-3 Tasks:** TransformerFAM shows a slight improvement over TransformerBSWA on some GPT-3 tasks, which is unexpected given that these tasks involve shorter sequences.
* **Effectiveness of FAM Length:** The optimal FAM length is found to be 64, suggesting that information compression is more effective with limited space.


**Comparison with Existing Literature:**

* **TransformerXL [26]:** The authors' results contradict the findings of TransformerXL regarding the use of stop gradients for memory segments. They argue that allowing gradients to flow to the memory segment is beneficial for learning.
* **RMT [57]:** TransformerFAM outperforms RMT on the PassKey retrieval task, particularly with longer filler contexts. This highlights the effectiveness of FAM in handling long sequences.
* **AutoCompressors [63]:** While AutoCompressors theoretically can handle long sequences, their performance degrades significantly with increasing sequence length, unlike TransformerFAM.
