### 2.1 Introduction

**Summary:** The introduction highlights the crucial role of embedding models in NLP tasks like IR and RAG. It emphasizes the limitation of current embedding models, which are typically confined to short context windows (e.g., 512 tokens), hindering their application in scenarios requiring long inputs. The authors then introduce their approach of extending the context window of existing models without retraining, motivated by successful LLM context extension techniques. They also introduce the LONGEMBED benchmark, designed to address limitations in existing benchmarks for long-context retrieval.

### 2.4 Methodology

**Summary:** This section details the core methodology of the paper, focusing on the two primary positional encoding schemes: Absolute Position Embedding (APE) and Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE). It explains how these schemes work and their differences. The section then dives into the training-free context extension strategies for APE-based models, including Parallel Context Windows (PCW), Grouped Positions (GP), Recurrent Positions (RP), and Linear Position Interpolation (PI). It also discusses the possibility of further fine-tuning on top of these methods. Finally, it explores context extension strategies for RoPE-based models, including SelfExtend (SE) and NTK-Aware Interpolation (NTK).

* **Claim:** "NTK-Aware Interpolation (NTK). Given a scaling factor s, PI proportionally down-scales position index m to m/s. In this way, the attention score a(q, k) defined in Equation 2 becomes g(q, k, (m - n)0/s). This is also equivalent to reducing the frequencies θ uniformly, which may prevent the model from learning high-frequency features, as shown by the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) theory (Jacot et al., 2018)."

* **Claim:** "As evidenced by previous findings (Xiong et al., 2023; Fu et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2024b; Yen et al., 2024), and the additional performance gain achieved via tuning on E5Base and GTEBase, we believe further fine-tuning on top of plug-and-play methods can bring even better extension results."
