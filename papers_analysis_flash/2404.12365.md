## 2. Section-by-Section Analysis with Citation Extraction

### 2.1 Introduction

**Summary:** This section introduces the challenge of few-shot text classification, especially when dealing with many semantically similar classes. It highlights the limitations of existing approaches, including few-shot prompting of LLMs and fine-tuning smaller language models, and introduces FastFit as a solution.

**Significant Citations:**

* **Claim:** "Few-shot prompting of LLMs leverages their multitasking abilities to tackle data scarcity. However, in the presence of many classes, LLMs encounter three major challenges: (1) LLMs struggle to incorporate demonstrations of all classes within their context window. (2) Utilization of the long context for the classification task can be challenging (Liu et al., 2023). (3) Inference time is slow due to model size, and prompt length."
    * **Citation:** Liu, H., Tam, D., Muqeeth, M., Mohta, J., Huang, T., Bansal, M., & Raffel, C. (2022). Few-shot parameter-efficient fine-tuning is better and cheaper than in-context learning. *arXiv preprint arXiv:2205.05638*.
    * **Relevance:** This citation supports the claim that using long contexts for classification with LLMs can be challenging, particularly in few-shot scenarios, and that inference time can be a bottleneck due to model size and prompt length.

However, these methods can be challenging to deploy as they require architectural adjustments (Yehudai et al., 2023) or, like SetFit, may prove less suitable for classification with many classes (Tunstall et al., 2022)."
