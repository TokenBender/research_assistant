### 2.12 User Study

**Summary:** This section describes a user study conducted to evaluate the perceptual quality of the facial animations generated by Learn2Talk, FaceFormer, and CodeTalker. It uses an A/B testing approach to compare the methods in terms of lip-synchronization and realism. The results show that users prefer the animations generated by Learn2Talk.
