The authors primarily cite works from the deep learning and computer vision communities, which is expected given the focus of the paper. However, there is a slight over-reliance on recent arXiv preprints, which might reflect the fast-paced nature of research in this area. It's important to note that the field is rapidly evolving, and future work might build upon a wider range of publications.


## 9. Final Summary

**Contribution to the Field:**

Groma represents a significant contribution to the field of MLLMs by introducing a novel paradigm for visual grounding. Its key innovation, localized visual tokenization, enables efficient and accurate grounding without the need for external modules. Groma demonstrates superior performance on various benchmarks, particularly in object localization and grounding.
