## 2. Section-by-Section Analysis with Citation Extraction

### 2.1 Introduction

- **Key Points:** Introduces the concept of chain-of-thought prompting and its impact on language model performance. Highlights the debate on whether chain-of-thought truly reflects human-like reasoning or simply leverages increased computational resources. Introduces the concept of "filler tokens" as a way to test this hypothesis.
- **Significant Citations:**

    a. **Claim:** "Chain-of-thought reasoning improves language model (LM) performance when compared to direct, no chain-of-thought, responses (Wei et al., 2023; Suzgun et al., 2022; Lanham et al., 2023)."
    b. **Citation:** Wei, J., Wang, X., Schuurmans, D., Bosma, M., Ichter, B., Xia, F., ... & Zhou, D. (2023). Chain-of-thought prompting elicits reasoning in large language models. 
    c. **Relevance:** This citation establishes the foundational observation that chain-of-thought prompting improves LM performance, setting the stage for the paper's investigation into the underlying mechanisms.

    a. **Claim:** "However, recent empirical work shows that answers arrived at via chains of thought frequently are not faithful to the intermediate reasoning steps taken within the chain (Lanham et al., 2023; Turpin et al., 2023)."
