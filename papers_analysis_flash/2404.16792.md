It finds that EXPO is most effective when applied to a combination of an SFT model and a model further trained on top of it, which is a common practice in LLM alignment.

**Significant Citations:**

* **Claim:** "From Figure 8, (1) we find that extrapolating from two SFT models that are initialized from different base models can easily lead to the model collapse, due to that they do not satisfy the mode connectivity [17, 15]."

    * **Relevance:** This citation connects the observed model collapse to the concept of mode connectivity, providing a theoretical explanation for the phenomenon.

* **Claim:** "Overall, our method EXPO is generally applicable to the combination of an SFT model M₀ and a model M₁ further trained on top of the former, which is a very realistic combination choice, as modern LLMs that are trained to align with human preference are almost all initialized from their SFT checkpoints."

## 4. Experimental Methodology and Its Foundations

**Experimental Setup:**

The authors evaluate EXPO on 12 open-source LLMs from HuggingFace, focusing on those with publicly available SFT and DPO/RLHF checkpoints. They use three benchmarks: AlpacaEval 2.0, MT-Bench, and Open LLM Leaderboard. For hyperparameter tuning, they utilize an open-source reward model trained on RewardBench. Controlled experiments are conducted using the alignment handbook [49] and the UltraFeedback dataset [12].

**Foundations:**

* **Alignment Handbook [49]:** Provides a standard codebase and recipe for LLM alignment training, ensuring reproducibility and comparability of results.
* **UltraFeedback Dataset [12]:** Serves as the primary dataset for training and evaluating the alignment of LLMs, providing a consistent and widely-used benchmark.
* **DPO and RLHF [42, 63]:** These are the primary alignment training methods used to generate the aligned models (M₁) that are then used as input for EXPO.
* **Model Interpolation/Averaging [51, 24, 54]:** The authors draw inspiration from this area of research, but EXPO differs in its approach of extrapolation rather than averaging.


**Novel Aspects:**

The core novelty of the paper lies in the **EXPO method**, which uses model extrapolation to improve alignment. The authors justify this novel approach by:

* **Observing the limitations of model interpolation:** They show that interpolation often leads to in-between performance, motivating the exploration of extrapolation.
* **Providing a theoretical explanation based on first-order approximation:** They demonstrate how EXPO can be viewed as implicitly optimizing the alignment objective.
* **Conducting extensive empirical experiments:** They show that EXPO consistently improves the performance of a wide range of LLMs.


## 5. Results in Context

**Main Results:**

* EXPO consistently improves the performance of off-the-shelf DPO/RLHF LLMs across various model sizes and capabilities on AlpacaEval 2.0, MT-Bench, and Open LLM Leaderboard.
* The improvements are substantial, with up to 10.1% win rate increase on AlpacaEval 2.0 and 0.66 score increase on MT-Bench.
* EXPO does not significantly impact the base model's capabilities, primarily focusing on improving alignment.
* Controlled experiments show that EXPO's effectiveness is influenced by training data size and hyperparameters.
* EXPO is most effective when applied to a combination of an SFT model and a model further trained on top of it.


**Comparison with Existing Literature:**

* The authors compare their results with the performance of the original DPO/RLHF models, demonstrating that EXPO consistently leads to improvements.
* They contrast EXPO with model interpolation techniques, highlighting that EXPO's extrapolation approach leads to better results than simple averaging.
* The controlled experiments compare the performance of models trained with varying amounts of data, showing that EXPO can boost models trained with less data to compete with or even outperform fully-trained models.


**Confirmation, Contradiction, or Extension:**

* The results **confirm** the general idea that further training can improve LLM alignment, but **extend** this idea by showing that extrapolation can achieve similar improvements without requiring additional training.
* The results **contradict** the common observation that model interpolation leads to in-between performance, demonstrating that extrapolation can lead to superior results.
* The results **extend** the literature on model merging and interpolation by introducing a novel extrapolation-based approach for improving LLM alignment.
