## 2. Section-by-Section Analysis with Citation Extraction

### 2.1 Introduction

**Summary:** The introduction establishes the context of question answering (QA) within Natural Language Understanding, highlighting the remarkable performance of LLMs on QA benchmarks. It then contrasts two primary approaches to LLM-based QA: closed-book (relying on parametric memory) and open-book (leveraging IR systems). The authors introduce the PopQA dataset and its findings regarding the importance of a hybrid approach, where LLMs use parametric memory for popular questions and IR for less popular ones. Finally, they present their research objective: to investigate whether LLMs can learn to automatically decide when to use IR.

## 4. Experimental Methodology and Its Foundations

**Experimental Setup:** The authors use three different model configurations: ADAPT-LLM (adaptive retrieval), NR-LLM (never retrieve), and AR-LLM (always retrieve). They train these models on the NQ and SQUAD datasets and evaluate their performance on the PopQA dataset. The base model used is Llama-2 [34], and the IR system is Contriever [11]. The training process involves fine-tuning the Llama-2 model using a custom dataset created by the authors, which incorporates both parametric and contextual prompts.

**Foundations:**

* **Llama-2 [34]:** The authors leverage the capabilities of Llama-2 as their base LLM, citing its open-source nature and strong performance in various NLP tasks.
* **Contriever [11]:** The authors utilize Contriever as their IR system, citing its unsupervised training on a large corpus and its effectiveness in retrieving relevant passages.
* **Alpaca-Lora [32]:** The authors adopt the training methodology and hyperparameters from Alpaca-Lora for fine-tuning their models, citing its success in instruction-following tasks.
* **PopQA [22]:** The authors use PopQA as their primary evaluation dataset, citing its unique design for evaluating the effectiveness of hybrid retrieval strategies.


**Novel Aspects:**

The primary novel aspect of the methodology is the introduction of ADAPT-LLM, a model that learns to dynamically decide when to retrieve information. The authors do not explicitly cite any specific work that justifies this novel approach, but they build upon the findings of Mallen et al. (2023) [22] and the concept of RAG [19] to develop their adaptive retrieval strategy.

**Main Results:**

* ADAPT-LLM consistently outperforms both NR-LLM and AR-LLM on the PopQA dataset, demonstrating the effectiveness of the adaptive retrieval approach.
* ADAPT-LLM effectively learns to determine when additional context is needed for accurate question answering, leading to improved accuracy when context is retrieved.
* ADAPT-LLM achieves comparable performance to the state-of-the-art approach on PopQA, which utilizes question popularity scores for determining retrieval, despite not using popularity scores during training or inference.
* The quality of the IR system significantly impacts the overall performance of retrieval-augmented LLMs, with the current IR system (Contriever) showing limitations in retrieving the most relevant passages.


**Comparison with Existing Literature:**

* **Confirmation:** The results confirm the findings of Mallen et al. (2023) [22] that LLMs' performance varies based on question popularity, and that a hybrid approach combining parametric memory and IR can be beneficial.
