## 2. Section-by-Section Analysis with Citation Extraction

### 2.1 Introduction

**Summary:** The introduction highlights the inherent diversity of image captions and how existing contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) methods limit their ability to capture this diversity. It introduces Llip (Latent Language Image Pretraining), a novel approach that models caption diversity by conditioning the visual representation on information derived from the text.

**Significant Citations:**

* **Claim:** "Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP; Radford et al. (2021)) combined with a large-scale weakly supervised dataset has become the standard Visual Language Pre-training (VLP) approach to learn visual representation (Li et al., 2021, 2023e; Sun et al., 2023; Zhai et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2023)."
