**9. Final Summary**

- **Contribution to the Field:**
    - The paper makes a significant contribution to the field of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) by demonstrating that pure data scaling can enable MLLMs to reason in 3D space without requiring 3D-specific architectural design or training objectives.
    - The paper introduces Cube-LLM, a novel MLLM that exhibits strong 3D perception capabilities and outperforms existing baselines on various 3D-grounded reasoning and complex reasoning tasks.
    - The paper highlights the importance of data scaling, visual chain-of-thought prompting, and specialist model prompting for training MLLMs for 3D understanding.
