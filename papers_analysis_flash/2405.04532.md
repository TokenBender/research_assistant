- **Potential Biases:** The authors primarily cite works from the deep learning and NLP research communities, which is appropriate given the topic of the paper. However, there might be a slight bias towards works published in top-tier conferences and journals, potentially overlooking some relevant research published in other venues.


## 9. Final Summary

- **Contribution:** The paper makes a significant contribution to the field of LLM serving by introducing the QoQ algorithm and QServe system. These innovations address the limitations of existing INT4 quantization methods and achieve significant performance improvements on GPUs.
- **Influential Cited Works:** TensorRT-LLM [25], Atom [44], QuaRot [2], SmoothQuant [38], GPTQ [12], vLLM [21] are among the most influential or frequently cited works.
- **Integration of Existing Literature:** The paper effectively integrates existing literature to support its claims and findings. It provides a clear overview of the relevant research in LLM quantization and LLM serving, highlights the limitations of existing approaches, and positions its own contributions within the broader research context. The authors effectively use citations to support their arguments and demonstrate the novelty of their work.
