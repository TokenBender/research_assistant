        - **Relevance:** These citations highlight the importance of data ownership and access in LLM training, motivating the need for a collaborative approach.
    - **Claim:** "We believe that incorporating such contributors directly into the federated learning process and offering them an incentive to participate, obtaining a model performing well on their data, is the natural next step in the proliferation of generative AI generally and LLMs in particular."

        - **Relevance:** These citations highlight the potential of FL to democratize LLM training and make it accessible to a wider range of participants.
    - **Claim:** "While some data-rich organizations may be unable or unwilling to invest in computing power, we believe that voluntarily partnering with a compute-rich yet data-poor one in a federated training context provides an excellent avenue for their participation."

        - **Relevance:** This statement highlights the potential of FL to facilitate collaboration between organizations with different resources.
    - **Claim:** "Pre-training should be possible without the strong synchronization requirements of standard data-parallel training [38] to accommodate geographically distributed and poorly connected participants."

        - **Relevance:** This statement highlights the need for FL to be communication-efficient, especially for geographically distributed participants.
    - **Claim:** "While such improvements boost efficiency for all participants in the federation, they also offer particular benefits to data sources that may have been underrepresented in the past."

        - **Relevance:** This statement highlights the potential of FL to address the challenges of NLP for low-resource languages.
    - **Claim:** "In the case of clients that may hold distributed compute nodes lacking the connectivity necessary to support the high-bandwidth Ring AllReduce algorithm necessary for classical data-parallel training (e.g., Infiniband), we perform local federated training over their compute nodes and transparently aggregate the node updates before sending results to the main server."
