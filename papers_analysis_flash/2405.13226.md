### 2.1 Introduction

**Summary:** This section introduces the common practice of training LLMs on datasets with fixed-length sequences created by concatenating and chunking documents. It highlights the drawbacks of this approach, including cross-document attention, computational inefficiency due to quadratic attention cost, and reduced average chunk lengths. The authors then introduce their proposed solution: dataset decomposition (DD) and variable sequence length (VSL) training.

### 2.3 Variable Sequence Length Training

**Summary:** This section details the VSL training approach, where at each optimization step, a bucket is sampled and a batch of sequences with the same length is extracted from that bucket. It highlights the advantages of VSL, including maintaining constant token count per step, adapting to sequence length variations in computational cost, and enabling different curricula for sequence lengths.

**Significant Citations:**

* **Claim:** "With VSL training, the cost of every optimization step depends on the bucket Di sampled for that step (and hence the sequence length). Thus, the more expensive steps (corresponding to long sequences) are compensated with less expensive steps (corresponding to short sequences)."

## 8. Critical Analysis of Citation Usage

**Effectiveness:** The authors generally use citations effectively to support their claims and findings. They provide a good overview of the relevant literature and clearly position their work within the broader research context.

**Areas for Improvement:**

* **Broader Context of Curriculum Learning:** While the authors connect their work to curriculum learning, they could have provided a more comprehensive overview of the different types of curriculum learning and their applications in LLMs.
* **More Citations on Hallucination Reduction:** Given the authors' suggestion to investigate the impact of their curriculum on hallucination reduction, including more citations on existing work related to hallucination reduction in LLMs would have been beneficial.
