**Significant Citations:**

* **Claim:** "Just like we can emulate int5 or int7 using an int8 datatype, likewise, we can emulate any eXmY format using bfloat16, if X < 8 and Y < 7, or using fp16, if X ≤ 5 and Y < 10, or using float32, if X < 8 and Y < 23. We preserve NaNs and Infs during emulation."
