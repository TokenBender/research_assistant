## 4. Experimental Methodology and Its Foundations

**Experimental Setup:** The authors conducted experiments on various generative models, including a one-sided uniform distribution, BigGAN, and Gaussian Mixture Models. They compared the performance of models trained with PLE to those trained with MLE, focusing on MADness and fairness.

**Foundations:**

* The authors used the concept of hypernetworks (Ha et al., 2017) as a core component of their methodology for implementing PLE.
* The choice of FID (Heusel et al., 2017a) as a metric for evaluating the quality of generated images is based on its established use in the field of generative modeling.
* The concept of MADness (Alemohammad et al., 2023) and its connection to model bias provided a key motivation for the development of PLE.
* The authors' approach to fairness is rooted in the concept of procedural fairness (Tyler, 1996) and the observation that MLE can exacerbate biases in unbalanced datasets (Zhao et al., 2018).

**Novel Aspects:**

* The introduction of PLE as a novel method for unbiased parameter estimation in generative models is a key novel contribution.
* The use of hypernetworks to implement PLE in a scalable way is a novel methodological approach.

## 5. Results in Context

**Main Results:**

* PLE effectively mitigates MADness in generative models, preventing the collapse of generated data quality over multiple generations.
* PLE produces fairer results in unbalanced datasets compared to MLE, improving the representation of minority classes.
* The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of PLE in various generative models, including a one-sided uniform distribution, BigGAN, and Gaussian Mixture Models.

**Comparison with Existing Literature:**

* The authors' results on MADness contradict the findings of previous work that showed generative models trained on their own output can suffer from a decline in quality (Alemohammad et al., 2023). PLE demonstrates that this decline can be mitigated by addressing the bias of MLE.
* The authors' results on fairness confirm the findings of previous work that showed generative models can exacerbate biases in unbalanced datasets (Zhao et al., 2018). However, PLE demonstrates that this issue can be addressed by using an unbiased estimator.
