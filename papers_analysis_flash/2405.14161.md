## 4. Experimental Methodology and Its Foundations

**Experimental Setup:** The authors evaluate STAR on a variety of ASR tasks, including noisy speech, accented speech, and specific scenarios. They use the Whisper-Large-V3 model as the base model and fine-tune it using Adam optimizer with gradient accumulation. They also employ various data filtering and re-weighting techniques based on confidence and attentive scores.

**Foundations:**

* **Pseudo-labeling and Informed Finetuning:** The authors use a standard self-training approach, which involves generating pseudo labels from the source model and then fine-tuning the model on the target domain data with these pseudo labels. This approach is supported by works like [79, 90].
* **STAR Indicator:** The novel aspect of the methodology is the STAR indicator, which combines confidence scores and attentive scores to assess the quality of pseudo labels. The authors justify this approach by highlighting the limitations of confidence scores alone [59, 76] and the potential of attentive scores for capturing linguistic acceptability [35].
* **Utterance-level Filtering:** The authors use techniques like Monte Carlo sampling [41] and beam search decoding [60] to filter out low-quality pseudo utterances. They cite these works to justify their approach to utterance-level filtering.

* In some cases, STAR's performance approaches the upper bound of supervised adaptation.
* STAR prevents catastrophic forgetting.
* STAR requires less than one hour of unlabeled data for adaptation.
* STAR is generalizable to various speech foundation models and tasks.

**Comparison with Existing Literature:**

* They also compare their results with the performance of supervised learning using real labels, which serves as an upper bound for source-free UDA.
* The results confirm the effectiveness of self-training for domain adaptation [79, 90] and demonstrate that STAR can further improve performance by using a more informative indicator for pseudo-label quality.
* The results also show that STAR can prevent catastrophic forgetting, which is a significant improvement over previous methods [9].
