**2.1 Introduction**

- **Key Points:** The introduction highlights the importance of aligning LLMs with human values and intentions through reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). It discusses the challenges of traditional RLHF methods, particularly the multi-stage procedure involving reward model training and policy optimization.

    - **Claim:** "In Table 5, we demonstrate results from ablating each key design of SimPO: (1) removing length normalization in Eq. (4) (i.e., w/o LN); (2) setting the target reward margin y to be 0 in Eq. (6) (i.e., γ = 0)."

    - **Explanation:** This claim introduces the ablation studies conducted in this section.
    - **Claim:** "Removing the length normalization has the most negative impact on the results."
    - **Citation:** None
    - **Explanation:** This claim highlights the significant impact of length normalization on performance.
    - **Claim:** "Our examination reveals that this leads to the generation of long and repetitive patterns, substantially degrading the overall quality of the output (See Appendix D)."
    - **Citation:** None
    - **Explanation:** This claim explains the negative impact of removing length normalization.
    - **Claim:** "Setting y to 0 yields also leads to a performance degradation compared to SimPO, indicating that it is not the optimal target reward margin."

    - **Explanation:** This claim highlights the impact of the target reward margin on performance.

**4.1 Length Normalization (LN) Prevents Length Exploitation**

- **Key Points:** This section analyzes the impact of length normalization on the reward difference and the average log probability of a sequence. The authors demonstrate that length normalization leads to an increase in the reward difference for all preference pairs, regardless of their length, and prevents length exploitation.
- **Citations:**
    - **Claim:** "The Bradley-Terry objective in Eq. (5) essentially aims to optimize the reward difference ∆r = r(x, yw) – r(x, y) to exceed the target margin γ."

    - **Explanation:** This citation explains the objective of the Bradley-Terry model.
    - **Claim:** "We investigate the relationship between the learned reward differences and the length difference Al = |Yw | - |y1| between the winning and losing responses from the training set of UltraFeedback."
    - **Citation:** None
    - **Explanation:** This claim explains the specific analysis conducted in this section.
    - **Claim:** "We observe that SimPO with LN consistently achieves a positive reward margin for all response pairs, regardless of their length difference, and consistently improves the margin over the SFT model."
    - **Citation:** None
    - **Explanation:** This claim highlights the positive impact of length normalization on the reward margin.
    - **Claim:** "In contrast, SimPO without LN results in a negative reward difference for preference pairs when the winning response is shorter than the losing response, indicating that the model learns poorly for these instances."
    - **Citation:** None
    - **Explanation:** This claim highlights the negative impact of removing length normalization.
    - **Claim:** "Removing LN results in a strong positive correlation between the reward and response length, leading to length exploitation."
