The authors use the HuggingFace Transformers library and the PEFT library for fine-tuning and adapter implementation. DoRA is used for creating adapters.
- **Foundations:** The methodology is based on the concepts of adapters (Bapna & Firat, 2019; Houlsby et al., 2019), LoRA (Hu et al., 2022), and DoRA (Liu et al., 2024).
