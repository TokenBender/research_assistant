**2. Section-by-Section Analysis with Citation Extraction:**

**2.1 Introduction:**

- **Key Points:**
    - Existing learning rate schedules that don't depend on the stopping time T are outperformed by schedules that do.
    - The paper aims to avoid the need for schedules while achieving state-of-the-art performance.
    - The authors highlight the theory-practice gap in optimization, particularly the suboptimality of Polyak-Ruppert (PR) averaging in practice.
    - They introduce a new approach that unifies scheduling and iterate averaging.
- **Significant Citations:**
    - **Claim:** "Existing learning rate schedules that do not require specification of the optimization stopping step T are greatly out-performed by learning rate schedules that depend on T."
        - **Citation:** Zamani and Glineur (2023) and Defazio et al. (2023)
        - **Relevance:** These works demonstrate the superiority of schedules that incorporate the stopping time T, motivating the need for a schedule-free approach.
    - **Claim:** "Classical convergence theory suggests that the expected loss of this z sequence is suboptimal, and that the Polyak-Ruppert (PR) average x of the sequence should be returned instead."
        - **Citation:** Polyak (1990); Ruppert (1988)
        - **Relevance:** This citation establishes the theoretical foundation for PR averaging and highlights its suboptimality in practice, setting the stage for the paper's proposed solution.

**2.2 Method:**

- **Key Points:**
    - The paper proposes a new method called "Schedule-Free SGD" that combines momentum and iterate averaging.
    - The method uses a momentum parameter β that interpolates between Polyak-Ruppert averaging (β = 0) and Primal averaging (β = 1).
    - The authors argue that this interpolation combines the fast convergence of Polyak-Ruppert averaging with the stability of Primal averaging.
- **Significant Citations:**
    - **Claim:** "Primal averaging (Nesterov and Shikhman, 2015; Tao et al., 2018; Cutkosky, 2019; Kavis et al., 2019; Sebbouh et al., 2021; Defazio and Gower, 2021; Defazio and Jelassi, 2022), is an approach where the gradient is evaluated at the averaged point x, instead of z."

    - They present a theorem that establishes optimal convergence rates for large learning rates under certain conditions.

    - **Claim:** "Our approach differs from conventional accelerated methods by using a different weight for the yt and xt interpolations. We use a constant weight for yt and a decreasing weight for xt. Accelerated methods for strongly-convex problems use a constant weight for both, and those for non-strongly convex use an decreasing weight for both, so our approach doesn't directly correspond to either class of accelerated method."
