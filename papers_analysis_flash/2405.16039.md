**Significant Citations:**

* **Claim:** "Virtually all modern Transformers make use of the so-called 'pre-layernorm' scheme [33, 34] (as opposed to the 'post-layernorm' one), that is, layer normalization [35] is applied before the attention layer (or analogously, the feedforward block), and their output is directly added to the residual."

    * **Relevance:** This citation establishes the common practice of using pre-layernorm in Transformers and introduces the concept of layer normalization, which is central to the paper's proposed solution.

* **Claim:** "Post-layernorm does not have this problem, since the whole residual is normalized after each layer. This coincides with the observation of Tan et al. [38] that post-layernorm performs better for UTs than pre-layernorm, and with the fact that the original UT [10] is trained with post-layernorm."
