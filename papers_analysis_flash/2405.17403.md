### 2.1 Introduction

**Summary:** The introduction highlights the computational cost of training diffusion models, citing examples like DALL-E 2 and Sora.

**Significant Citations:**

* **Claim:** "Training diffusion models is not usually affordable for many researchers, especially for ones in academia. For example, DALL-E 2 [40] needs 40K A100 GPU days and Sora [41] at least necessitates 126K H100 GPU days."

    * **Relevance:** These citations establish the high computational cost of training large diffusion models, motivating the need for acceleration techniques.
* **Claim:** "Recently, some acceleration methods for diffusion training focus on time steps, primarily using re-weighting and re-sampling 1) Re-weighting on the time steps based on heuristic rules. P2 [8] and Min-SNR [15] use monotonous and single-peak weighting strategies according to sign-to-noise ratios (SNR) in different time steps. 2) Re-sampling the time steps. Log-Normal [25] assigns high sampling probabilities for the middle time steps of the diffusion process. CLTS [61] proposes a curriculum learning based time step schedule, gradually tuning the sampling probability from uniform to Gaussian by interpolation for acceleration as shown in Fig. 1b."

### 2.2 A Closer Look at Time Steps

**Summary:** This section delves into the core analysis of the paper, focusing on the process increment (dt) at each time step. It introduces Theorem 1 and Remark 1, which provide bounds for the process increment and form the basis for identifying three distinct areas: acceleration, deceleration, and convergence. The authors analyze the behavior of the process increment in each area and discuss the implications for training efficiency.

**Significant Citations:**

* **Claim:** "In DDPM, the diffusion model learns the noise added in the forward process at given tth time step. The noise is presented as e, the label in Eqn. 1, which is the normalized process increment at given time step. This label tells what the output of the diffusion model is aligning to. To take a closer look, we focus on the nature of the process increment de itself to study the diffusion process xt → Xt+1, instead of e the normalized one."

* **Claim:** "Theorem 1 (Process increment in DDPM). In DDPM's setting [19], the linear schedule hyper-parameters {ẞt}t∈[T] is an equivariant series, the extreme deviation ∆β := maxt ßt – mint ßt, T is the total number of time steps, and we have the bounds about the process increment d+ ~ Ν(Φt, Ψt), where ¢t := (√√at+1 − 1)√ātxo, Ψt := [2 − āt(1 + at+1)]I, I is the unit matrix, as follows:"

This inflection point represents the peak where the process increment changes most rapidly. The key time-step ta-d between acceleration and deceleration areas satisfies ta-d = arg maxł dłŶt and ẞta-a = √∆β/T in our setting, where dłŶt = 2(βο + ∆βt/T) exp{−(βο + ∆pt/2T)t}."

### 2.3 Overview of SpeeD

**Summary:** This section introduces SpeeD, the proposed method for accelerating diffusion model training. It outlines the core ideas of SpeeD, which are asymmetric sampling and change-aware weighting. The authors explain how these techniques address the issues identified in the previous section, namely the imbalance in time steps and the limited benefit of convergence-area steps.

**Significant Citations:**

* **Claim:** "Based on the above observations and analyses, we propose SpeeD, a novel approach for achieving lossless training acceleration tailored for diffusion models. As illustrated in Fig. 2, SpeeD suppresses the trivial time steps from convergence area, and weight the rapid-change intervals between acceleration and deceleration areas."
    * **Citation:** (None explicitly cited for this general claim, but the overall approach builds upon the analysis in the previous sections)
    * **Relevance:** This claim introduces the core idea of SpeeD and connects it to the previous analysis of time steps.


### 2.4 Asymmetric Sampling

**Summary:** This section details the asymmetric sampling strategy used in SpeeD. It explains how the sampling probability is adjusted to suppress the sampling of time steps from the convergence area while increasing the sampling of steps from other areas. It also introduces the concept of a threshold (τ) for determining which time steps are suppressed.

**Significant Citations:**

* **Claim:** "SpeeD adopts the time steps sampling probability P(t) as the step function in Eqn. 3 to construct the loss in Eqn. 1. We first define 7 as the step threshold in P(t). The pre-defined boundary 7 means the area where the time step are suppressed."
    * **Citation:** [19] Jonathan Ho, Ajay Jain, and Pieter Abbeel. Denoising diffusion probabilistic models. NeurIPS, 33:6840-6851, 2020.
    * **Relevance:** This claim connects the proposed sampling strategy to the loss function used in diffusion models, which is a core component of the training process.


### 2.5 Change-Aware Weighting

**Summary:** This section describes the change-aware weighting strategy, which aims to emphasize the importance of time steps with rapid changes in the process increment. It explains how the weights are assigned based on the gradient of the variance over time and introduces a symmetry ceiling (λ) to regulate the curvature of the weighting function.

**Significant Citations:**

* **Claim:** "According to Theorem 1, a faster change of process increment means fewer samples at the corresponding noise level. This leads to under-sampling in acceleration and deceleration areas. Change-aware weighting is adopted to mitigate the under-sampling issue."
