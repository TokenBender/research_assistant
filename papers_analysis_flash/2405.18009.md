Beyond the context window, the positional encodings at larger position indices are out-of-distribution (OOD), not encountered during the training phase. Therefore, when the input sequence exceeds the context window length, there would often be a significant degradation in model performances, as evidenced by a surge in perplexity (PPL) score [6]."
