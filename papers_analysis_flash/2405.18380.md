### 2.3 Methodology

**Summary:** This section introduces the OwLore approach, starting with a discussion of the limitations of LISA. The authors then delve into the concept of outlier distribution in LLMs and its connection to Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization (HT-SR) theory. They propose that layers with a higher prevalence of outliers tend to be more heavy-tailed and better trained, leading to the core idea of OwLore: assigning higher sampling probabilities to these outlier-rich layers. Finally, they integrate gradient low-rank projection to further enhance memory efficiency during fine-tuning.

- OwLore demonstrates superior memory efficiency compared to LISA and LoRA, allowing for fine-tuning of larger models with limited resources.
- OwLore's training loss curve initially lags behind LISA but eventually surpasses it, suggesting that the low-rank updates gradually converge to an optimal solution.

**Comparison with Existing Literature:**

- **Confirmation:** OwLore's results confirm the findings of previous studies that highlighted the importance of outliers in LLMs [23, 40, 53].
- **Extension:** OwLore extends the work of LISA [38] by introducing a more principled layerwise sampling strategy based on outlier ratios and integrating low-rank projection for improved memory efficiency.
- **Contradiction:** OwLore's results contradict the findings of some studies that suggested LoRA's performance is inferior to full fine-tuning [49, 2], demonstrating that OwLore can achieve comparable or better performance with significantly less memory.
