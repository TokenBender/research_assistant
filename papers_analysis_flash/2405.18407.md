**2. Section-by-Section Analysis with Citation Extraction:**

**2.1 Introduction:**

- **Key Points:** The introduction highlights the dominance of diffusion models [11, 9, 36, 41] in generative image synthesis [27, 24, 5] and the challenge of their iterative nature. It introduces consistency models [35, 34] as a solution for efficiency and their extension to text-to-image synthesis with LCMs [21]. The authors then identify three key limitations of LCMs: inconsistency, uncontrollability, and inefficiency, illustrated in Figure 1.
- **Citations:**
    - **Claim:** Diffusion models have emerged as the dominant methodology for generative image synthesis.
    - **Citation:** [11, 9, 36, 41]
    - **Relevance:** This citation establishes the context of diffusion models as the foundation for the paper's research.
    - **Claim:** These models have shown the ability to generate high-quality and diverse examples conditioned on varying signals.
    - **Citation:** [27, 24, 5]
    - **Relevance:** This citation highlights the success of diffusion models in image generation, motivating the search for more efficient methods.
    - **Claim:** To address this challenge, consistency models [35, 34] have emerged to reduce the number of iterative steps required to generate a sample.
    - **Citation:** [35, 34]
    - **Relevance:** This citation introduces consistency models as a key concept in the paper's approach to improving efficiency.
    - **Claim:** These models have been extended to high-resolution text-to-image synthesis with latent diffusion models (LCM) [21].
    - **Citation:** [21]
    - **Relevance:** This citation introduces LCMs as the specific type of consistency model the paper focuses on.

**2.2 Consistency:**

- **Key Points:** This section discusses the inconsistency issue in LCMs, attributing it to the purely stochastic multi-step sampling algorithm [35, 34] and the resulting variability in results across different inference steps.
- **Citations:**
    - **Claim:** Due to the specific consistency property, CMs and LCMs can only use the purely stochastic multi-step sampling algorithm, which assumes that the accumulated noise variable in each generative step is independent and causes varying degrees of stochasticity for different inference-step settings.
    - **Citation:** [35, 34]
    - **Relevance:** This citation directly links the inconsistency issue to the underlying methodology of LCMs.

**2.3 Controllability:**

- **Key Points:** This section discusses the controllability limitations of LCMs, specifically their sensitivity to classifier-free guidance (CFG) [10] and their insensitivity to negative prompts.
- **Citations:**
    - **Claim:** Even though Stable Diffusion can accept classifier-free guidance (CFG) [10] in a wide range of inference steps (i.e. 2-15), equipped with LCM weights, they can only accept CFG with 1-2 steps.
    - **Citation:** [10]
    - **Relevance:** This citation introduces CFG as a key aspect of controllability in diffusion models.

**2.4 Efficiency:**

- **Key Points:** This section discusses the efficiency limitations of LCMs, particularly their poor performance in few-step settings. The authors attribute this to the use of L2 or Huber loss [35, 34], which they argue is insufficient for fine-grained supervision in low-step regimes.
- **Citations:**
    - **Claim:** We find that LCM tends to generate much inferior results at the few-step settings, especially in less than 4 inference steps, which limits the sampling efficiency.
    - **Citation:** [35, 34]
    - **Relevance:** This citation connects the efficiency issue to the specific design choices made in LCMs.

**2.5 Proposed Model: PCM:**

- **Key Points:** The authors introduce PCM as a solution to the limitations of LCMs. PCM phases the ODE trajectory into sub-trajectories and enforces self-consistency on each sub-trajectory, enabling deterministic sampling without error accumulation.
- **Citations:** None. This section introduces a novel approach, PCM, without directly citing existing works.

**3. Key Insights and Supporting Literature:**

- **Key Insight:** LCMs suffer from limitations in consistency, controllability, and efficiency due to their reliance on purely stochastic multi-step sampling, insensitivity to CFG, and use of L2 or Huber loss.
- **Supporting Citations:** [10, 35, 34, 21]
- **Contribution:** This insight highlights the shortcomings of existing LCMs and sets the stage for the introduction of PCM.
- **Key Insight:** PCM addresses these limitations by phasing the ODE trajectory into sub-trajectories, enforcing self-consistency on each sub-trajectory, and using a novel adversarial consistency loss.
- **Supporting Citations:** None. This insight is based on the authors' novel contributions.

**4. Experimental Methodology and Its Foundations:**
