   - **Relevance:** This citation explains the core function of the CHAIR metric in evaluating hallucination rates.


### 4.3 Large Vision Language Models

**Summary:** This subsection lists the specific LVLMs used in the experiments and their configurations.

**Significant Citations:**
- **Claim:** "We evaluate our approach on four state-of-the-art open-source LVLMs, i.e., InstructBLIP (Vicuna-7B) [8], mPLUG-Owl (LLaMA-7B) [67], MiniGPT-4 (Vicuna-7B) [73], and LLaVa 1.5 (Vicuna-7B) [23], all of them using G = 32 attention heads."
