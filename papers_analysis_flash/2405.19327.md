- **Citations:**
    - **Claim:** "Data Colonialism is a deep concern when firms decide to exploit an algorithm product. [27] conceptualize the data colonialism framework and argue that Big Tech Giants, particularly in the U.S., use their massive data power to manipulate human behaviors and judgments and track people's traces continuously, forming a new social order. This suggests that controlling and owning data benefits firms' market status and generates large returns. So, making LLMs as firms' proprietary models is a common practice in the industry. [2] discuss the barriers to AI democratization, such as the concentration of AI capabilities in large tech firms and elite universities. They underscore the importance of democratizing access to AI resources to mitigate the risks of data colonialism and promote equitable access to AI technologies across all institutions. [91] discuss the dominance of proprietary LLMs and the need for high-performing open-source alternatives. They propose methods to enhance open-source models to compete with proprietary models while addressing privacy and resource-constrained concerns. They also point out how important the open-source model is in the LLMs community and acknowledge that firms with fewer resources and sensitive information are hesitant to trust the proprietary models. However, most LLMs are the product of a massive English corpus and are trained from English scratch [122]. How the open-source model can benefit the non-English language community and its data democratization remains unclear."
