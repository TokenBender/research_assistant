## 4. Experimental Methodology and Its Foundations

**Experimental Setup:** The authors primarily focus on Llama-2-7b-chat-hf and Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 LLMs. They compare their BiPO method with two baselines: CAA [26] and a Freeform approach [33]. They evaluate the steering effectiveness across various behaviors, including AI personas, truthfulness, hallucination, and jailbreaking, using specific benchmark datasets for each. The evaluation is primarily based on open-ended generation tasks, with human evaluation (using GPT-4) and metrics like Attack Success Rate (ASR) for jailbreaking.

**Foundations in Cited Works:**

* **CAA:** The authors use CAA [26] as a baseline, adopting its approach of using contrastive prompt pairs to extract steering vectors.
* **Freeform:** The Freeform approach [33] is also used as a baseline, which explores freeform paired prompts for steering vector extraction.
* **DPO:** The authors draw inspiration from DPO [25] for their BiPO method, adopting its concept of directly optimizing a model to human preferences.
* **GPT-4:** GPT-4 is used extensively for human evaluation of model responses, following the approach of [24, 4].

**Novel Aspects of Methodology:**

The core novelty lies in the BiPO method itself. The authors introduce the concept of bi-directional preference optimization, where the steering vector is optimized to directly influence the generation probability of contrastive pairs. This approach allows the model to "speak up" rather than simply "following" a prompted direction, leading to more effective steering. The authors justify this novel approach by highlighting the limitations of existing methods, particularly in alignment-related scenarios.


## 5. Results in Context

**Main Results:**

* BiPO consistently outperforms baseline methods (CAA and Freeform) in steering various behaviors across different LLMs.
* BiPO achieves a broader range of steering effects for AI personas compared to baselines.
* BiPO significantly improves model truthfulness and reduces hallucination compared to baselines.
* BiPO effectively facilitates jailbreaking and defends against jailbreaking attacks, while baselines struggle due to inconsistencies in their training data.
* Steering vectors generated by BiPO exhibit strong transferability across different LLMs and LoRAs.
* Combining multiple steering vectors can lead to synergistic effects, enabling more complex steering.

**Comparison with Existing Literature:**

* **Confirmation:** The results confirm the findings of [26] that steering vectors can be used to influence LLM behavior, but BiPO extends this by achieving a broader range of control.
* **Extension:** The results extend the work of [25] by demonstrating that preference optimization can be effectively used to extract steering vectors for LLMs.
* **Contradiction:** The results contradict the findings of [26] that CAA is effective in all scenarios, showing that BiPO is superior in alignment-related scenarios.
