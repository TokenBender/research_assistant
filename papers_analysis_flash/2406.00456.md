- **Novel Aspects of Methodology:**
    - **Mix-of-Granularity (MoG):** The core novelty lies in the introduction of MoG, which dynamically determines the optimal granularity level for retrieving knowledge chunks based on user queries. The authors justify this approach by citing the limitations of fixed-size chunking and the need for adaptive retrieval strategies.
    - **Mix-of-Granularity-Graph (MoGG):** The MoGG extension is novel in its use of graph-based knowledge representation to enhance the retrieval of distantly related information.
