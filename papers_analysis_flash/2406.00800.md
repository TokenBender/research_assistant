**Explanation:**

The cited works provide the foundation for the paper's key insights. For instance, [1, 14] establish the memory bandwidth bottleneck in LLM inference, motivating the need for techniques like PTQ. The extensive list of citations in [2, 10, 16, 17, 20, 24, 32, 33, 39, 40] demonstrates the growing interest in PTQ for LLMs. The works cited in [5, 18, 19, 29, 34] highlight the limitations of existing PTQ methods, setting the stage for MagR's contribution. The observation of rank-deficient feature matrices in [5, 41] provides a crucial motivation for MagR's design. Finally, the experimental results in [11, 30, 31] demonstrate the effectiveness of MagR in improving PTQ accuracy.


## 4. Experimental Methodology and Its Foundations

**Experimental Setup:**

The authors evaluate MagR on the LLaMA1 and LLaMA2 families of LLMs, using WikiText2 and C4 datasets for language generation tasks and several zero-shot tasks (PIQA, ARC, Winogrande) for evaluating generalization capabilities. They employ two gradient-free PTQ methods (RTN and OPTQ) as baselines and compare MagR's performance against them, as well as against other PTQ methods like AWQ, OmniQuant, and QuIP. The experiments involve INT2, INT3, and INT4 weight quantization, with both per-channel and per-group quantization schemes.

**Foundations:**

The experimental methodology builds upon existing work in PTQ, particularly the gradient-free methods like RTN and OPTQ. The authors cite [11] for OPTQ and [18] for AWQ, establishing the baseline methods used for comparison. The choice of LLaMA models is motivated by their popularity and the growing interest in quantizing large language models. The datasets are chosen based on their common use in evaluating LLMs.

**Novel Aspects:**

The core novelty lies in the MagR preprocessing technique itself, which uses l∞-regularization to reduce weight magnitude. The authors justify this approach by leveraging the concept of rank-deficient feature matrices in LLMs, as discussed in Section 4.1. The use of proximal gradient descent with l₁-ball projection for efficiently solving the l∞-regularized optimization problem is also a novel aspect of the methodology.
