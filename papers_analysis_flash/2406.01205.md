**Highlighting Novelty:**

The authors use these citations to emphasize the novelty of ControlSpeech in several ways:

- **Simultaneous Control:** ControlSpeech is the first TTS model capable of simultaneously achieving zero-shot timbre cloning and style control, unlike previous models that focused on either one or the other.
- **Decoupled Codec:** ControlSpeech leverages a decoupled codec, which is a relatively new approach in TTS, to achieve independent control of timbre and style.
- **SMSD Module:** The SMSD module is a novel approach to address the many-to-many problem in style control, which was not adequately addressed in previous work.
- **VccmDataset and ControlToolkit:** The creation of these resources makes it easier for other researchers to build upon the work presented in the paper.

**Supporting Citations:** (The future work section primarily discusses potential research directions and does not introduce new citations.)


## 8. Critical Analysis of Citation Usage

**Effectiveness of Citation Usage:**

The authors generally use citations effectively to support their claims and findings. They provide a good overview of the relevant literature and clearly demonstrate how their work builds upon and extends existing research.


**Areas for Improvement:**

- **More Contextualization in Related Work:** While the appendix provides a more detailed discussion of related work, the main body could benefit from a slightly more in-depth discussion of the connections and distinctions between ControlSpeech and other relevant models.
- **Discussion of Limitations:** The authors acknowledge some limitations in the conclusion and appendix, but a more detailed discussion of these limitations in the main
