### 2.3 Pyramidal Information Funneling

**Summary:** This section presents the core observation that drives the PyramidKV design. The authors analyze the attention patterns in LLMs during a multi-document question answering task and observe a "pyramidal information funneling" pattern. This pattern involves a broad, global attention in lower layers, followed by progressively more localized attention in middle layers, and finally, a concentration of attention on a few key tokens in higher layers (the "massive activation" or "attention sink" phenomenon).

**Significant Citations:**

* **Claim:** "To systematically understand the attention mechanism over layers in LLMs for long-context inputs, we conduct a fine-grained study focusing on the multi-document question answering (QA) task."
    * **Citation:**  **[Implicitly referencing the LongBench dataset and the multi-document QA tasks within it, likely Bai et al., 2023. Longbench: A bilingual, multitask benchmark for long context understanding. arXiv preprint arXiv:2308.14508].**
    * **Explanation:** This establishes the experimental setup for the analysis of attention patterns.
* **Claim:** "We identify an approximately uniform distribution of attention scores from the lower layers (e.g., the 0th layer). This suggests that the model operates in a broad-spectrum mode at the lower layers, aggregating information globally from all available content without prioritizing its attention on specific input segments."
    * **Citation:**  **[Implicitly referencing the analysis of attention patterns in LLaMa, likely Touvron et al., 2023. Llama: Open and efficient foundation language models. arXiv preprint arXiv:2302.13971].**
    * **Explanation:** This is a key observation that supports the "pyramidal information funneling" hypothesis.
* **Claim:** "This trend continues and intensifies in the upper layers (from the 24th to the 30th layer), where we observed the emergence of ‘massive attention' phenomena."
    * **Citation:**  **[Implicitly referencing the "massive activation" or "attention sink" phenomena discussed in the related work section, likely Sun et al., 2024.

### 2.4 PyramidKV and Problem Formulation

**Summary:** This section formally defines the problem of KV cache compression and introduces the core idea of PyramidKV.
