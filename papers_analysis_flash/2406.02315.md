## 2. Section-by-Section Analysis with Citation Extraction

### 2.1 Introduction

**Summary:** The introduction highlights the increasing use of generative models for multimedia content, including music. It then focuses on the challenges of music generation using language models, particularly the issue of multi-stage quantization and the trade-off between modeling the joint distribution of codebooks (which is computationally expensive) and the product of marginal distributions (which can be inaccurate if codebooks are not independent). The authors propose a novel independence-promoting loss to address this issue.

**Significant Citations:**

- **Claim:** "Music generation schemes using language modeling rely on a vocabulary of audio tokens, generally provided as codes in a discrete latent space learnt by an auto-encoder."
  - **Citation:** (Défossez et al., 2023; Zeghidour et al., 2021).
  - **Relevance:** This establishes the common practice of using auto-encoders and quantization for music representation in language models, setting the stage for the paper's focus.

- **Claim:** "Multi-stage quantizers are often employed to produce these tokens, therefore the decoding strategy used for token prediction must be adapted to account for multiple codebooks: either it should model the joint distribution over all codebooks, or fit the product of the codebook marginal distributions."
  - **Citation:** (Défossez et al., 2023; Zeghidour et al., 2021).
  - **Relevance:** This introduces the core problem addressed in the paper: the choice between computationally expensive joint distribution modeling and potentially inaccurate marginal distribution modeling.

- **Claim:** "Several strategies for modelling the factorized distribution have been proposed ... yielding satisfying results. However, we argue that these solutions do not directly address the issue, which is that the factorized distribution is equivalent to the full joint distribution only if the codebooks are mutually independent."
  - **Citation:** (Wang et al., 2023; Kharitonov et al., 2022; Kreuk et al., 2023; Copet et al., 2023).
  - **Relevance:** This highlights the limitations of existing approaches and emphasizes the need for a method that directly addresses the codebook independence issue.


### 2.2 Background

**Summary:** This section provides background on quantization, including scalar and vector quantization, and multi-stage vector quantization. It then discusses the concept of independence of random variables and the challenges of measuring mutual information. The authors explain why they choose the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) as a proxy for mutual information.

**Significant Citations:**

- **Claim:** "Quantization is a discretization method aiming at reducing the bitrate used to encode information, which is a major challenge in low-resource communications."
  - **Citation:** (Gray, 1984).
  - **Relevance:** This provides the foundational context for quantization, a core technique in the paper's domain.

- **Claim:** "Vector quantization (VQ) ... learns a codebook C with M vectors of dimension N and at inference, it performs a nearest neighbour search in the codebook space to find the right code for the input signal."
  - **Citation:** (Gray, 1984).
  - **Relevance:** This explains the basic concept of vector quantization, which is central to the paper's approach to audio tokenization.

- **Claim:** "Multi-stage vector quantizers ... use multiple codebooks with reasonable size, which increases codebook utilization compared to having one large codebook."
  - **Citation:** (Juang & Gray, 1982; Vasuki & Vanathi, 2006).
  - **Relevance:** This introduces the concept of multi-stage quantization, which is the specific type of quantization used in the paper's target application.

- **Claim:** "Reliably measuring statistical dependence between random variables is a wide-spread topic in the machine learning literature."
  - **Citation:** (Higgins et al., 2017; Burgess et al., 2017; Brakel & Bengio, 2017; Hyvarinen et al., 2023; Belghazi et al., 2018).
  - **Relevance:** This establishes the importance of measuring independence in machine learning, providing context for the paper's focus on promoting codebook independence.

- **Claim:** "Another convenient distance between probability distributions is the earth mover distance, defined as..."
  - **Citation:** (Villani, 2009).
  - **Relevance:** This introduces the earth mover distance, which is related to the MMD, the chosen proxy for mutual information in the paper.

- **Claim:** "Since MMD is equivalent to the earth mover distance, if MMD(Pz||Pz) = 0 then the joint distribution Pz and the factorized distribution Pz are equal and therefore the family {Z1,..., ZK} is independent."
  - **Citation:** (Gretton et al., 2012).
  - **Relevance:** This establishes the core theoretical foundation for using MMD as a proxy for independence, linking it to the desired outcome of the paper.

  - **Citation:** (Copet et al., 2023).
  - **Relevance:** This highlights the core challenge addressed in the paper: the need to adapt decoding strategies for language models when dealing with multiple codebooks.

- **Claim:** "Several alternative decoding strategies have been introduced: (Wang et al., 2023) propose to fully model the distribution of the first codebook, then to learn the factorized distribution over the remaining codebooks, while (Borsos et al., 2023; Agostinelli et al., 2023) model the first four codebooks with a first decoder, then the remaining eight codebooks with a second decoder."
