- BoT enables smaller LLMs to achieve performance comparable to or even exceeding larger LLMs on challenging tasks.


**Comparison with Existing Literature:**

The authors compare their results with existing methods, including CoT, PAL, Expert Prompting, ToT, GoT, and Meta Prompting. They demonstrate that BoT consistently outperforms these methods in terms of accuracy, particularly on complex reasoning tasks. The results also show that BoT achieves a better trade-off between model size and performance compared to larger LLMs.

**Confirmation, Contradiction, or Extension:**

The results of the paper largely confirm the potential of prompt engineering and thought-augmented reasoning to improve LLM performance. However, BoT extends existing methods by introducing a novel framework that leverages a meta-buffer of high-level thought-templates to achieve better generalization and efficiency. The results also contradict the common assumption that larger LLMs are always superior, demonstrating that BoT can enable smaller models to achieve comparable or even better performance on certain tasks.
