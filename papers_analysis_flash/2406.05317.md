* **Claim:** "During the pre-filling stage, prompts are split into segments of size B before being fed into the LLM. These segments sequentially pass through the LLM, generating and compressing KVs via Equation 3, resulting in compressed KVs of length M that encapsulate the context information."
    * **Relevance:** This statement describes the pre-filling process for inference, which is a crucial step in the LoCoCo method.


* **Claim:** "As our "dropping-in" term implies, the pre-trained weights remain unchanged, allowing users to switch back to the uncompressed mode simply by removing the compressor heads, when sufficient resources are available for a linearly scaled KV cache."
    * **Relevance:** This statement emphasizes the "drop-in" nature of the LoCoCo method, highlighting its ease of integration with existing LLMs.


* **Claim:** "Long-Context Extension Our method also supports long context extension through post-training tuning, allowing pre-trained LLMs to handle longer contexts without incurring the excessive memory costs."
    * **Relevance:** This statement introduces the capability of LoCoCo to extend the context length of pre-trained LLMs through fine-tuning.


* **Claim:** "We achieve this by leveraging positional interpolation (Chen et al., 2023a), inserting compressor heads, and adding LoRA adapters to fine-tune the pre-trained model, following Chen et al. (2023b)'s practice."

    * **Relevance:** This citation connects the fine-tuning procedure to existing methods like positional interpolation and LoRA, demonstrating how LoCoCo builds upon existing techniques.
