**2. Section-by-Section Analysis with Citation Extraction**

**2.1 Introduction**

- **Key Points:**
    - LLMs with billions of parameters demonstrate impressive performance, but the MHA mechanism incurs substantial computational and memory costs during inference.
    - Existing methods like pruning heads or sharing parameters often lead to performance degradation or require substantial pre-training costs.
    - DHA adaptively configures group sharing for key and value heads across layers, achieving a better balance between performance and efficiency.
    - DHA is constructed by transforming MHA checkpoints into DHA models through linear fusion of similar head parameters, retaining the parametric knowledge of the MHA checkpoint.
    - DHA significantly reduces pre-training budgets while achieving comparable performance to the original MHA model.

**2.3 Observation**

- **Key Points:**
    - The authors observe that there are head clusters with high internal similarity in MHA checkpoints, indicating redundancy.
    - This redundancy is more pronounced in value heads than key heads and varies across different layers.

    - DHA allocates different numbers of key and value heads at different layers to balance model efficiency and performance.
    - The transformation from MHA to DHA involves three stages: Search, Fusion, and Continued Pre-training (CT).
    - The Search stage involves grouping similar functional heads together and determining reasonable allocations of key and value heads for each layer.
    - The Fusion stage involves performing linear fusion on similar heads, ensuring the preservation of original functionality.
    - The CT stage involves fine-tuning the DHA model to restore performance.
