**4. Experimental Methodology and Its Foundations**

* **Experimental Setup:** The authors evaluate their TernaryLLM on various LLM families (OPT and LLaMA) using standard NLP benchmarks, including text generation and zero-shot tasks. They employ RedPajama dataset for training and utilize the AdamW optimizer with cosine learning rate decay.
* **Foundations:**
    * **Dual Learnable Ternarization (DLT):** This novel approach addresses the asymmetric outlier problem by introducing learnable scales and shifts in the ternarization process.
        * **Justification:** The authors observe the asymmetric distribution of weights in LLMs and propose DLT as a solution.
    * **Outlier-Friendly Feature Knowledge Distillation (OFF):** This method leverages cosine similarity to maximize the mutual information between features in the original and quantized models, mitigating the negative impact of outliers on KD.
        * **Justification:** The authors argue that cosine similarity is insensitive to outliers and thus better suited for KD in LLMs.
    * **Straight-Through Estimator (STE):** This technique is used to approximate the gradients of the ternarized weights, enabling backpropagation during training.

**5. Results in Context**

* **Main Results:** TernaryLLM consistently outperforms previous low-bit quantization methods (e.g., RTN, GPTQ, AWQ, OmniQuant, PB-LLM, DB-LLM) on both language generation and zero-shot tasks across various LLM families. Notably, for LLaMA-3, TernaryLLM achieves a 5.8 perplexity reduction on C4 and an 8.2% accuracy improvement on zero-shot tasks compared to the previous state-of-the-art method (W2A16).
* **Comparison with Existing Literature:**
    * **Confirmation:** The results confirm that weight-only quantization is generally more effective than weight-activation quantization for LLMs due to the presence of outliers in activations.
    * **Extension:** The results demonstrate that TernaryLLM can achieve significantly better performance than previous low-bit quantization methods, particularly in the context of LLMs.
    * **Contradiction:** The results contradict the findings of some previous works that suggested extreme low-bit quantization leads to severe performance degradation in LLMs.
