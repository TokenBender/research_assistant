    - These citations provide a basis for the suggested future work, particularly in the areas of hybrid model design and training optimization.


## 8. Critical Analysis of Citation Usage

- **Effectiveness of Citation Usage:** The authors generally use citations effectively to support their claims and findings. They provide a comprehensive overview of the relevant literature and clearly indicate the sources of their ideas and methods.
- **Areas for Improvement:**
    - While the paper cites a wide range of relevant works, it could benefit from including more citations related to specific aspects of the experimental setup, such as the choice of hyperparameters and optimization techniques.
    - The paper could also benefit from a more detailed discussion of the limitations of SAMBA and how it compares to other hybrid models in the literature.
- **Potential Biases:**
    - The paper primarily focuses on citations from the deep learning and natural language processing communities, which is appropriate given the topic.
    - There is a slight over-reliance on citations from Microsoft researchers, but this is likely due to the fact that the authors are affiliated with Microsoft.


## 9. Final Summary

- **Contribution to the Field:** SAMBA represents a significant contribution to the field of language modeling by introducing a novel hybrid architecture that combines the strengths of SSMs and attention mechanisms. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of benchmarks while maintaining linear time complexity and the ability to extrapolate memory recall to very long contexts.
- **Influential/Frequently Cited Works:**
    - [VSP+17] (Attention is All You Need)
