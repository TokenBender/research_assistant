**2. Section-by-Section Analysis with Citation Extraction:**

**2.1 Introduction:**

- **Key Points:**
    - LLMs face challenges in handling long context sequences due to the quadratic complexity of the attention mechanism.
    - Existing approaches like FlashAttention [9, 8] and sparse attention methods [20, 4, 41, 35, 16, 36, 28] have limitations in real-world applicability due to performance degradation, complexity, or the need for retraining.
- **Significant Citations:**
    - **Claim:** "Despite their success, as the model size and cost of state-of-the-art Transformer-based generative models continue to grow, the quadratic complexity of the attention mechanism is increasingly becoming a critical obstacle, which is exacerbated with a growing demand to deal with with longer sequences."

**2.3 Methodology:**

- **Key Points:**
    - The paper describes the HiP attention mechanism, which consists of two parts: mask estimation and sparse attention computation.
    - The mask estimation process utilizes a tree-search-like algorithm to dynamically generate a sparse attention mask that restricts the number of accessible tokens for each query.
    - The sparse attention computation is performed in O(T) time using the generated mask.
- **Significant Citations:**
    - **Claim:** "This is done by dividing the input key-value sequence into k groups, and then further dividing them into half, evaluating the importance of the tokens in each group while retaining the top k important groups globally, until the groups cannot be further divided."

    - **Explanation:** This citation explains the hierarchical pruning process used in HiP, which is inspired by the sliding window approach in StreamingLLM.
    - **Claim:** "Since the masking process requires O(log T) iterations and performs mask estimation for each query, the complexity of masking iterations is O(T log T)."
    - **Citation:** [39] Xiao, G., Tian, Y., Chen, B., Han, S., and Lewis, M. Efficient streaming language models with attention sinks. In The Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations, 2024.
    - **Explanation:** This citation justifies the log-linear complexity of the mask estimation process in HiP.
    - **Claim:** "Furthermore, HiP considers modern hardware characteristics from the bottom of the method design. In contrast to previous approaches [20, 16], our method is aware of the tensor processing unit (e.g., TensorCore) by processing each masking and sparse attention process in tiled computation pattern [37]."
