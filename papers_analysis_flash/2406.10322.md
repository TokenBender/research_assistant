### 2.2 Related Work

- **Summary:** This section reviews existing work on position encodings, focusing on absolute, relative, and contextual encodings. It discusses the limitations of previous methods, particularly RoPE, and highlights the need for a more generalizable approach.
- **Key Citations:**
    - **Claim:** "Absolute encodings generally operate on a per token-level, modifying the embedding of a token to encode the location of the token in the text or media. Classic methods such as sinusoidal embeddings of learned embeddings achieve this by adding either a learned or carefully designed vector to the embedding of the token before it is passed through the transformer [25, 6, 8]."

### 2.3 Background: Lie Groups in the Context of Attention

- **Summary:** This section provides a brief introduction to Lie groups, explaining their relevance to the proposed LieRE method. It highlights the key property of Lie groups that allows for encoding relative positions.
- **Key Citations:**
    - **Claim:** "Lie groups are smooth manifolds that are closed under matrix multiplication and inversion. For every Lie group, the matrix exponential provides a smooth bijective map from a subset of Rnxn (hereto referred to as the generator set) to the Lie group. The exponential map is a diffeomorphism and has the following key property for generators x, y close together: exp(x - y) = exp(-y + x) ≈ (exp(y))¯¹ exp(x) [9]."

### 2.4 Methods: Rotations for Relative Positions in Attention

- **Summary:** This section explains how LieRE modifies the attention mechanism by applying rotations to the keys and queries. It highlights the connection between Lie groups and the rotation matrices used in the method.
- **Key Citations:**
    - **Claim:** "Recall that, for every pair of tokens, the attention mechanism computes the inner products between their key and query vectors, kqj. We encode the positions by multiplying by the rotation matrices in the prior part. In particular, we update the keys and queries as k₁ = kiRi and qj = qjRj. This results in an updated inner product of (Riki)TRjqj = kiRRjqj = kiRiRjqj."
    - **Citation:** (No direct citation, but builds upon the established understanding of the attention mechanism from [25] and RoPE from [21]).
    - **Explanation:** This explanation describes the core modification to the attention mechanism introduced by LieRE, which is the application of rotation matrices to keys and queries.
    - **Claim:** "Recall that by equation 1, Rī¹Rj = exp(Pi)-1 exp(P;) ≈ exp(Pj – P₁). In other words, the inner product automatically computes the relative position encoding."
    - **Citation:** (No direct citation, but builds upon the established understanding of the attention mechanism from [25] and RoPE from [21]).
