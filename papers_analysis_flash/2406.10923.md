## 4. Experimental Methodology and Its Foundations

**Experimental Setup:** The paper uses a variety of LLM-based video reasoning methods as baselines, including Captioner-Reasoner (LLoVi), Large Multimodal Model Instruction Fine-tuning (SEVILA and LLaMA-VID), and Visual Programming (ViperGPT). They then propose two enhancements to ViperGPT: FEVORI and ConQueR. The experiments are conducted on the TiM dataset, which consists of 684 movies annotated with trope labels. The evaluation is performed using a 5-fold cross-validation approach, with the primary metric being the F1 score.

**Foundations in Cited Works:**

* **Captioner-Reasoner:** The Captioner-Reasoner approach is based on the work of Zhang et al. (2023) and leverages VLMs like BLIP-2 to generate captions for video frames, which are then fed into an LLM for reasoning.
* **Large Multimodal Model Instruction Fine-tuning:** The LMM-IF approach is based on the work of Yu et al. (2023) and utilizes multimodal models to localize keyframes and perform reasoning on those frames.
* **Visual Programming:** The VP approach is based on the work of Surís et al. (2023) and uses LLMs to generate programs that call visual perception modules to perform reasoning.
* **FEVORI:** This enhancement builds upon ViperGPT and introduces face detection to improve the understanding of character interactions, addressing the challenge of abstract perception. It draws inspiration from DeepFace (Serengil & Ozpinar, 2021).
* **ConQueR:** This enhancement further improves ViperGPT by systematically decomposing the narrative context and trope query, addressing the challenge of long-range compositional reasoning. It draws inspiration from the NEXT-QA dataset (Xiao et al., 2021).


**Novel Aspects of Methodology:**

* **TiM Dataset:** The TiM dataset is a novel contribution, specifically designed to evaluate abstract perception and long-range compositional reasoning in the context of movie tropes.
* **FEVORI:** The integration of face detection into ViperGPT is a novel approach to enhance role awareness and improve abstract perception.
