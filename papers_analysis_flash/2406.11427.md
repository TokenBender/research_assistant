### 2.1 Introduction

**Summary:** The introduction highlights the impressive generative capabilities of large-scale diffusion models across various modalities, including images, videos, and audio. However, it emphasizes the challenges of applying these models to TTS due to the need for precise temporal alignment between text and speech, often requiring complex pipelines with domain-specific components.

* DiTTo-TTS achieves superior or comparable zero-shot performance to state-of-the-art TTS models in terms of naturalness, intelligibility, and speaker similarity.
* DiTTo-TTS significantly outperforms baselines like Simple-TTS and CLaM-TTS in subjective evaluations.
* DiTTo-TTS achieves a 4.6x faster inference speed and a 3.84x smaller model size compared to CLaM-TTS.
* DiTTo-TTS demonstrates effective scalability with respect to data and model size.
* Fine-tuning the neural audio codec with a pre-trained language model improves performance.

**Comparison with Existing Literature:**

* **Confirmation:** The results confirm the effectiveness of diffusion models for audio generation, as suggested by previous works like Ho et al. (2020) and Rombach et al. (2022).
* **Extension:** The results extend the application of diffusion models to TTS, demonstrating their potential for high-quality speech synthesis without relying on domain-specific components, which was not fully explored in previous works like Shen et al. (2023) and Ju et al. (2024).
* **Contradiction:** The results contradict the notion that domain-specific modeling is essential for high-quality TTS, as suggested by some previous works like Shen et al. (2023).
* **Comparison:** The results are compared to various baselines, including VALL-E, SPEAR-TTS, CLaM-TTS, YourTTS, Voicebox, Simple-TTS, and NaturalSpeech, demonstrating DiTTo-TTS's competitive performance.
