### 2.1 Introduction

**Summary:** The introduction highlights the growing importance of DPO for aligning LLMs with human preferences and its recent extension to multimodal scenarios. However, it notes that simply applying DPO to multimodal data doesn't consistently improve performance and can even exacerbate issues like hallucination. The authors introduce the concept of "unconditional preference" in multimodal DPO, where the model prioritizes language over visual information, and propose MDPO as a solution.

### 2.2 The Pitfall of Preference Optimization

**Summary:** This section delves into the background of DPO and introduces the core problem of unconditional preference in multimodal DPO. It explains how the standard DPO objective, while theoretically expecting the model to consider both image and language, often leads to the model prioritizing language-only cues and neglecting the image context. This is demonstrated through a controlled experiment where removing images from the preference data doesn't significantly impact model performance.

**Significant Citations:**

* **Claim:** "Recent studies have found inconsistent improvements in model capabilities when applying DPO to multimodal LLMs, often attributing this issue to the quality of preference data (Li et al., 2023; Sarkar et al., 2024)."

    * **Relevance:** These citations acknowledge previous work that has attempted to address the challenges of multimodal DPO, but they suggest that the problem might be more fundamental than just data quality.

* **Claim:** "DPO does not effectively utilize the visual modality in the preference dataset."
    * **Citation:** (No specific citation is provided for this claim, but it's supported by the controlled experiment described in the paper.)
    * **Relevance:** This claim introduces the core argument of the paper, which is that the failure of DPO in multimodal settings is due to the model's tendency to ignore the visual modality.


### 2.3 MDPO

**Summary:** This section introduces MDPO, the proposed solution to the unconditional preference problem. MDPO incorporates two additional objectives into the standard DPO: conditional preference optimization and anchored preference optimization. Conditional preference optimization encourages the model to learn from image-only preference pairs, forcing it to consider the visual information. Anchored preference optimization ensures that the likelihood of the chosen response doesn't decrease during training.

**Significant Citations:**

* **Claim:** "We propose a conditional preference optimization objective to address the issue of ignoring visual information in preference data."
    * **Citation:** (No specific citation is provided for this claim, but it's a novel contribution of the paper.)
    * **Relevance:** This introduces the core idea of conditional preference optimization, a key component of MDPO.

* **Claim:** "We also observe that the likelihood of the chosen response often decreases during the optimization process of DPO."
    * **Citation:** (No specific citation is provided for this claim, but it's a common observation in DPO.)
    * **Relevance:** This observation motivates the introduction of anchored preference optimization, another key component of MDPO.
