### 2.2 Background

#### 2.2.1 Binarization of LLMs

- **Key Points:** This section provides a formal definition of binarization, explaining how it converts full-precision weight parameters into 1-bit values using a sign function and scaling factors. It discusses the role of scaling factors in bridging the gap between full-precision and binarized weights. The authors also highlight the sensitivity of LLMs to binarization compared to other deep learning models like CNNs, citing works that demonstrate this sensitivity [9, 11, 10, 12]. This leads to the discussion of various binarization techniques tailored for LLMs, including PB-LLM, BiLLM, and OneBit [5, 6, 7], which are further explained in the context of Figure 1.

- **Significant Citations:**

    a. **Claim:** "While binarization has been effectively applied in traditional deep learning models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification without losing accuracy [9, 11, 10, 12], LLMs tend to be more sensitive to such extreme quantization, often experiencing significant accuracy degradation with standard binarization techniques."

### 3. Proposed BinaryMoS

#### 3.1 Binarization with Mixture of Scale

- **Key Points:** This section delves into the core of the proposed BinaryMoS method. It explains how BinaryMoS integrates the MoE concept into the scaling factors of binarization, using multiple scaling experts instead of a single one. The authors emphasize that while scaling factors are relatively small, they are crucial for accuracy, making the introduction of multiple experts a memory-efficient way to enhance model capacity. They also highlight the linearity of scaling factor operations, which allows for efficient combination of multiple experts during inference.

- **Significant Citations:** (No direct citations in this section, but it builds upon the concepts introduced in Section 2.2.2)


#### 3.2 Router Design

- **Key Points:** This section describes the design of the router component in BinaryMoS. The router is responsible for generating token-adaptive scaling factors by linearly combining the outputs of multiple scaling experts. It uses a softmax function to compute gating scores, which represent the importance of each expert for a given token. These gating scores are then used to weight the scaling experts, resulting in a context-aware scaling factor for each token.

#### 3.3 Impact of BinaryMoS on LLM Compression

- **Key Points:** This section analyzes the memory overhead introduced by BinaryMoS due to the additional scaling experts and router weights. The authors demonstrate that this overhead is relatively small, constituting only a fraction of the original weight parameters. They present a comparison of memory requirements for different binarization techniques (PB-LLM, BiLLM, OneBit, and BinaryMoS) across various LLaMA models (Table 1). The results show that BinaryMoS achieves significantly higher compression ratios compared to other methods while maintaining comparable memory efficiency to OneBit.

#### 3.4 Quantization-Aware Knowledge Distillation

- **Key Points:** This section describes the knowledge distillation (KD) technique [13, 14] used to train the BinaryMoS models. KD transfers knowledge from a full-precision teacher model to a binarized student model using a combination of cross-entropy (CE) loss and mean-squared error (MSE) based layer-to-layer (L2L) loss.
