### 2.4 Automatic Pipeline for MoA Compression

**Summary:** This section details the automatic pipeline for MoA compression, illustrated in Figure 3(b). It describes the four main steps: attention influence profiling, automatic optimization, calibration dataset construction, and heterogeneous elastic rules. The profiling step quantifies the impact of each attention value on the prediction loss using gradient-based profiling and a calibration dataset. The optimization step then selects the optimal elastic rule for each head to minimize accuracy loss while adhering to density constraints. The calibration dataset is designed to include long-range dependencies and model alignment, and the heterogeneous elastic rules are tailored to each attention head.
