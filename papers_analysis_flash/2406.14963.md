## 4. Experimental Methodology and Its Foundations

**Experimental Setup:** The authors evaluate their proposed AsymGQA method on several popular decoder-only language models (OPT, LLaMA, LLaMA-2) and benchmark datasets (QNLI, MNLI, SST2, MMLU). They employ a search-based approach to find the optimal grouping of attention heads, using cosine similarity between activation vectors to measure layer similarity. The models are fine-tuned using both full fine-tuning and LoRA.

**Foundations:**

* **GQA:** The authors build upon the concept of GQA (Ainslie et al., 2023), which aims to reduce computational complexity by grouping attention heads.
* **LoRA:** The authors utilize LoRA (Hu et al., 2021) for parameter-efficient fine-tuning, a common practice in large language model optimization.
* **Cosine Similarity:** The use of cosine similarity for measuring layer similarity is a standard technique in machine learning.

**Novel Aspects:**

* **Activation-Informed Grouping:** The core novelty of the paper lies in the activation-informed grouping approach, which uses activation similarity to guide the search for optimal groupings. The authors do not directly cite any prior work that uses this specific approach for attention head grouping.
* **Asymmetric Grouping:** The authors introduce asymmetric grouping, allowing for varied group sizes, which is a novel extension to the existing GQA methods. They justify this approach by arguing that it can be beneficial in scenarios where the relevance of information is not uniformly distributed.


## 5. Results in Context

**Main Results:**

* AsymGQA consistently outperforms the baseline GQA and symmetric grouping methods across various models and datasets.
* The accuracy gains are more significant on challenging tasks like MMLU.
* AsymGQA effectively manages the trade-off between model performance and hardware efficiency by allowing for varied group sizes.

**Comparison with Existing Literature:**

* The authors compare their results with the baseline GQA method, which is based on neighbour grouping.
* They also compare their results with symmetric grouping, which is a variant of GQA that uses activation-informed similarity but maintains equal group sizes.

**Confirmation, Contradiction, or Extension:**

* The results confirm the potential of GQA for improving hardware efficiency.
* The results demonstrate that activation-informed grouping can further improve performance compared to naive neighbour grouping.
* The results extend the GQA framework by introducing asymmetric grouping, which allows for varied group sizes and leads to further performance gains.
