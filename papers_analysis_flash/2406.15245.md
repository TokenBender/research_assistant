### 2.3 Methodology

**Summary:** This section details the proposed methodology, which involves a composition model for inducing morphological structure and a novel tokenization algorithm called TreeTok. The composition model utilizes a MorphOverriding mechanism to handle morphemes and employs self-supervised objectives for training. TreeTok then leverages the induced tree structures for vocabulary construction and word segmentation.

**Significant Citations:**

* **Claim:** "Our approach draws inspiration from syntactic composition models (Maillard et al., 2017), where a sentence is encoded as a weighted sum over all composed root representations of its underlying binary parse trees via dynamic programming."
    * **Citation:** (Maillard et al., 2017)
    * **Relevance:** This citation establishes the connection between the paper's approach and syntactic composition models, which are used as a source of inspiration for inducing morphological structure.
* **Claim:** "Morphemes, the smallest meaning-bearing units in a language (Jurafsky and Martin, 2009), are indecomposable."
    * **Citation:** (Jurafsky and Martin, 2009)
    * **Relevance:** This citation defines morphemes and emphasizes their indecomposability, which is a key challenge addressed by the MorphOverriding mechanism.

    * **Citation:** (Viterbi, 1967)
    * **Relevance:** This citation introduces the Viterbi algorithm, which is used in the TreeTok method for efficient pruning of the vocabulary.
* **Claim:** "The auto-encoding objective turns out to be empirically ineffective when training our model probably because unlike word-level auto-encoding that requires selecting from tens of thousands of words in a vocabulary, here we only need to select from tens of characters, which is much less challenging."
    * **Citation:** (Hu et al., 2021)
    * **Relevance:** This citation acknowledges a limitation of the standard auto-encoding approach and motivates the need for the proposed modifications to enhance learning efficacy.
