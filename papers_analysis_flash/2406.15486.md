### 2.1 Introduction

**Summary:** The introduction highlights the increasing context window sizes in LLMs [1-5, 6-8] for complex applications like document analysis [9], code generation [10, 11], and conversations [12, 13]. It emphasizes the quadratic complexity of attention, leading to increased Time-to-First-Token (TTFT) latency, especially with longer contexts (e.g., ChatGLM-6B [17] taking 1555 seconds for a 1 million token context). The authors discuss existing approaches to approximate attention [18-26, 27-29, 30, 31, 32-34, 35, 36] and their limitations, particularly the need for pretraining or finetuning and accuracy loss. They introduce SampleAttention as a solution that aims to reduce TTFT without accuracy loss.
