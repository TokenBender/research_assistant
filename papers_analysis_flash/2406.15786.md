## 5. Results in Context

**Main Results:**

* **Attention Layer Redundancy:** The authors find that Attention layers exhibit high redundancy, with up to 50% of them being safely pruned without significant performance degradation.
* **MLP Layer Sensitivity:** Dropping MLP layers leads to a substantial performance drop, indicating their importance in the model.
* **Block Drop Ineffectiveness:** Block Drop, which drops entire Transformer blocks, significantly degrades performance.
* **Joint Layer Drop Effectiveness:** Joint Layer Drop, which combines Attention and MLP layer dropping, achieves the best performance and dropping ratios.
