    - The focus on Voicebox and VALL-E as key points of comparison might overshadow other relevant works in the field.


## 9. Final Summary

- **Contribution:** The paper makes a significant contribution to the field of TTS by introducing E2 TTS, a simple yet effective fully NAR zero-shot TTS system that achieves state-of-the-art performance. It demonstrates that complex architectures and duration models are not necessary for high-quality NAR zero-shot TTS.
- **Influential Cited Works:**
    - **Voicebox [18]:** Frequently cited as a point of comparison and inspiration for the model architecture and training objective.
    - **VALL-E [8]:** A key milestone in zero-shot TTS, providing context for the shift towards neural codec language modeling.
    - **Flow-matching [20]:** The core technique used in the mel spectrogram generator.
    - **Transformer [26] and U-Net [23]:** The foundation for the model architecture.
- **Integration of Existing Literature:** The paper effectively integrates existing literature to support its claims and findings. It provides a clear context for its work by referencing relevant prior research in TTS, highlighting the limitations of existing approaches, and demonstrating the superiority of E2 TTS. The authors effectively use citations to support their arguments and findings, making the paper a valuable contribution to the field.
