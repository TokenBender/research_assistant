### 2.3 Methodology

**Summary:** This section details the proposed Selective Prompt Tuning (SPT) method, including its architecture, components (soft prompt group, dense retriever, frozen LLM), and the training process. It explains how the SPT method addresses the challenges of personalized dialogue generation by dynamically selecting soft prompts based on context and incorporating context-prompt contrastive learning and prompt fusion learning to enhance diversity and prevent overfitting.

**Significant Citations:**

* **Claim:** "In persona-based dialogue sessions, a context is represented as C = {P,U}, where P = {P1,..., Pe} denotes the persona comprising e sentences (e.g., 4 ≤ e ≤ 5) to provide background information for a machine interlocutor m and U = {Uh,1, Um,1,..., Uh,n} denotes the dialogue context initiated by the human h to capture the exchange between human h and machine m."
    * **Citation:** None directly cited for this specific formulation, but it builds upon the general concept of persona-based dialogue systems established in the related work section, particularly (Zhang et al., 2018) and (Dinan et al., 2019).
    * **Relevance:** This defines the problem setting for the SPT method, establishing the format of the input data (persona and dialogue history) and the desired output (machine response).

* **Claim:** "The SPT framework, consisting of a soft prompt group, a dense retriever, and a frozen LLM."
    * **Citation:** None directly cited for this specific architecture, but it draws inspiration from prompt tuning techniques (Lester et al., 2021) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods.
    * **Relevance:** This introduces the core components of the SPT method, which are crucial for understanding how it functions.

* **Claim:** "The soft prompt group, denoted by SP = {sp1, ..., spk}, consists of K soft prompts with random initialization."
    * **Citation:** None directly cited for this specific initialization, but it's a common practice in deep learning to initialize parameters randomly.
    * **Relevance:** This describes the initialization of the soft prompts, which are the trainable components that guide the LLM towards generating personalized responses.

* **Claim:** "The soft prompt selection is done by a trainable retriever, Ret(·, ·), which calculates the similarity score SC,sp = {SC,1,..., SC,K} between the context embedding embc from the LLM and each candidate spi in the soft prompt group SP."
    * **Citation:** None directly cited for this specific retriever design, but it's inspired by information retrieval techniques and the use of dense retrievers in other NLP tasks.
    * **Relevance:** This explains how the retriever component works, selecting the most appropriate soft prompt for a given context based on similarity.

* **Claim:** "To reduce computational overhead, the dense retriever Ret utilizes two linear layers, i.e., ling and linsp, for computing the similarity scores {SC,i}."
    * **Citation:** None directly cited for this specific choice of linear layers, but it's a common practice in deep learning for efficient similarity calculations.
    * **Relevance:** This provides a specific implementation detail of the retriever, highlighting its efficiency.

* **Claim:** "While the aforementioned losses aid in training, there is a risk that the retriever often retrieves a single prompt and stagnates in such sub-optimal states. To alleviate this and foster prompt diversity to retrieve more prompts, we propose a context-prompt contrastive loss."
    * **Citation:** None directly cited for this specific contrastive loss formulation, but it's inspired by contrastive learning techniques used in other areas of deep learning.
    * **Relevance:** This introduces the context-prompt contrastive loss, which is designed to encourage the retriever to explore a wider range of soft prompts, promoting diversity in the generated responses.

* **Claim:** "To optimize the effectiveness of the soft prompts, we introduce a prompt fusion learning loss. This loss averages the predictive probabilities from all the soft prompts in the soft prompt group, aiming to aggregate a unified outcome that closely aligns with the desired output."
    * **Citation:** None directly cited for this specific prompt fusion loss formulation, but it's inspired by ensemble methods and the idea of combining predictions from multiple models.
    * **Relevance:** This introduces the prompt fusion loss, which aims to combine the predictions from different soft prompts, leading to more robust and reliable outputs.
