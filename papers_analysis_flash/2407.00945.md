**2.1 Introduction:**

- **Key Points:**
    - Large language models (LLMs) with billions to trillions of parameters pose significant deployment challenges due to their demands on memory, processing power, and energy consumption. [21, 65, 53]
    - Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) architectures have emerged as a solution, activating only a subset of parameters per token, achieving faster inference while maintaining performance. [45, 14, 27, 19, 20, 4, 50, 57]
    - However, SMoE models still face limitations in broader deployment due to their large parameter counts and significant GPU memory requirements.
    - The paper introduces Efficient Expert Pruning (EEP) to enhance the pruning of experts in SMoE models, achieving greater sparsity while maintaining or even improving performance on downstream tasks.
    - EEP relies solely on model inference (i.e., no gradient computation) and can be used to reduce both the total number of experts (thus saving GPU memory) and the number of active experts (thus accelerating inference).
