### 2.1 Introduction

**Summary:** The introduction highlights the importance of aligning LLMs with human preferences for safe and beneficial real-world applications. It introduces RLHF [33] as a common alignment method and discusses its limitations, leading to the development of DPO [35] as a more efficient and stable alternative. DPO directly learns from human preferences, avoiding the explicit reward model learning step.
