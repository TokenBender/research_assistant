### 3 FlashAttention-3: Algorithm

**Summary:** This section details the FlashAttention-3 algorithm, focusing on the forward pass. It introduces three key innovations: producer-consumer asynchrony through warp-specialization and pingpong scheduling, hiding softmax under asynchronous block-wise GEMMs, and hardware-accelerated low-precision GEMM using FP8.

**Significant Citations:**

* **Claim:** "As with FLASHATTENTION-2, the forward pass of FLASHATTENTION-3 is embarrassingly parallel in the batch size, number of heads, and query sequence length."
    * **Relevance:** This statement highlights the inherent parallelism in the attention computation, which is leveraged by the algorithm.
* **Claim:** "To simplify the description, we first give the warp-specialization scheme with a circular SMEM buffer that does not have in addition the GEMM-softmax overlapping."
    * **Relevance:** This explains the initial step in the algorithm, which involves dividing the computation into warps and using shared memory efficiently.
* **Claim:** "The asynchronous nature of WGMMA and TMA, along with warp-specialization, opens up the opportunity to overlap the softmax computation of one warpgroup with the GEMM of another warpgroup."
    * **Relevance:** This statement introduces the concept of pingpong scheduling, a key optimization technique that leverages asynchrony to hide latency.
* **Claim:** "However, correctly invoking FP8 WGMMA entails understanding the layout constraints on its operands."
    * **Relevance:** This statement introduces the challenges associated with using FP8, specifically the need to manage data layouts in a way that is compatible with the hardware.
* **Claim:** "In the context of attention, these layout restrictions entail certain modifications to the design of an FP8 algorithm, which we describe in ยง3.3."
    * **Relevance:** This statement foreshadows the discussion of the FP8 implementation details, which are crucial for achieving the desired performance gains.

* **Claim:** "In addition, Hopper supports the dynamic reallocation of registers between warpgroups via setmaxnreg [40, ยง9.7.17.1], so those warps doing MMAs can obtain a larger share of RMEM than those just issuing TMA (for which only a single thread is needed)."
    * **Citation:** [40]
    * **Relevance:** This citation provides the source for the information about the dynamic register allocation feature in Hopper, which is leveraged by the algorithm.


### 3.2 Intra-Warpgroup Overlapping GEMMs and Softmax

**Significant Citations:**

* **Claim:** "First, we note that the input tensors Q, K, and V are typically given as contiguous in the head dimension, while to satisfy the k-major constraint on FP8 WGMMA for the second GEMM we need V, or rather the tiles of V loaded into SMEM, to be contiguous in the sequence length dimension."
    * **Relevance:** This statement highlights the layout mismatch between the input data and the requirements of FP8 WGMMA.
* **Claim:** "Instead, for FP8 FLASHATTENTION-3 we opt for option (2). For the in-kernel transpose, we take advantage of the LDSM (1dmatrix) and STSM (stmatrix) instructions, which involve a warp of threads collectively loading SMEM to RMEM and storing RMEM to SMEM at a granularity of 128 bytes."
    * **Relevance:** This explains the chosen solution for addressing the layout mismatch, which involves performing an in-kernel transpose using specialized instructions.
* **Claim:** "Moreover, large models typically have outlier values [20, 54] that are much larger in magnitude than most other values, making quantization difficult."
