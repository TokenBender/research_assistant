### 3 FlashAttention-3: Algorithm

**Summary:** This section details the FlashAttention-3 algorithm, focusing on the forward pass. It introduces three key innovations: producer-consumer asynchrony through warp-specialization and pingpong scheduling, hiding softmax under asynchronous block-wise GEMMs, and hardware-accelerated low-precision GEMM using FP8.

**Significant Citations:**

* **Claim:** "As with FLASHATTENTION-2, the forward pass of FLASHATTENTION-3 is embarrassingly parallel in the batch size, number of heads, and query sequence length."
    * **Relevance:** This statement highlights the inherent parallelism in the attention computation, which is leveraged by the algorithm.
* **Claim:** "To simplify the description, we first give the warp-specialization scheme with a circular SMEM buffer that does not have in addition the GEMM-softmax overlapping."
    * **Relevance:** This explains the initial step in the algorithm, which involves dividing the computation into warps and using shared memory efficiently.
* **Claim:** "The asynchronous nature of WGMMA and TMA, along with warp-specialization, opens up the opportunity to overlap the softmax computation of one warpgroup with the GEMM of another warpgroup."
    * **Relevance:** This statement introduces the concept of pingpong scheduling, a key optimization technique that leverages asynchrony to hide latency.
* **Claim:** "However, correctly invoking FP8 WGMMA entails understanding the layout constraints on its operands."
    * **Relevance:** This statement introduces the challenges associated with using FP8, specifically the need to manage data layouts in a way that is compatible with the hardware.
* **Claim:** "In the context of attention, these layout restrictions entail certain modifications to the design of an FP8 algorithm, which we describe in §3.3."
    * **Relevance:** This statement foreshadows the discussion of the FP8 implementation details, which are crucial for achieving the desired performance gains.


### 3.1 Producer-Consumer Asynchrony through Warp-Specialization and Pingpong Scheduling

**Summary:** This subsection explains how warp-specialization is used to divide the warps within a CTA into producer and consumer roles, improving instruction scheduling and register allocation. It also introduces pingpong scheduling, a technique to overlap softmax computations with GEMM operations, further improving performance.

* **Claim:** "In addition, Hopper supports the dynamic reallocation of registers between warpgroups via setmaxnreg [40, §9.7.17.1], so those warps doing MMAs can obtain a larger share of RMEM than those just issuing TMA (for which only a single thread is needed)."
    * **Citation:** [40]
    * **Relevance:** This citation provides the source for the information about the dynamic register allocation feature in Hopper, which is leveraged by the algorithm.


### 3.2 Intra-Warpgroup Overlapping GEMMs and Softmax

**Summary:** This subsection discusses the challenges and techniques used to implement FlashAttention-3 with FP8 precision. It addresses layout transformations required to satisfy the constraints of FP8 WGMMA and introduces block quantization and incoherent processing to mitigate the loss of accuracy associated with lower precision.

**Significant Citations:**

* **Claim:** "First, we note that the input tensors Q, K, and V are typically given as contiguous in the head dimension, while to satisfy the k-major constraint on FP8 WGMMA for the second GEMM we need V, or rather the tiles of V loaded into SMEM, to be contiguous in the sequence length dimension."
    * **Relevance:** This statement highlights the layout mismatch between the input data and the requirements of FP8 WGMMA.
* **Claim:** "Instead, for FP8 FLASHATTENTION-3 we opt for option (2). For the in-kernel transpose, we take advantage of the LDSM (1dmatrix) and STSM (stmatrix) instructions, which involve a warp of threads collectively loading SMEM to RMEM and storing RMEM to SMEM at a granularity of 128 bytes."
    * **Relevance:** This explains the chosen solution for addressing the layout mismatch, which involves performing an in-kernel transpose using specialized instructions.
* **Claim:** "Moreover, large models typically have outlier values [20, 54] that are much larger in magnitude than most other values, making quantization difficult."
