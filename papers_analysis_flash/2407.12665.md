## 4. Experimental Methodology and Its Foundations

The paper employs a standard Transformer architecture, building upon the LLaMA model (Touvron et al., 2023a). The core novelty lies in the patch-level training approach, which involves:

1. **Patch Creation:** Dividing the input token sequence into patches of size K.
2. **Patch Embedding:** Representing each patch as the average of its constituent token embeddings.
3. **Patch-Level Training:** Training the model to predict the next patch based on the current patch sequence.
4. **Token-Level Fine-tuning:** Using the parameters learned during patch-level training to initialize a token-level model, which is then fine-tuned on the remaining data.

**Foundations:**

* The authors cite **Vaswani et al. (2017)** and **Touvron et al. (2023a)** as the basis for the Transformer architecture.
* The concept of **transfer learning** is implicitly cited as the foundation for the knowledge transfer from patch-level to token-level training.
* The idea of **multi-token prediction** is mentioned as a related concept, but the authors emphasize that their approach differs in its focus on training efficiency rather than inference speed.
* The authors explore the impact of different **hyperparameters** (K and λ) on model performance, citing related work on **model growth** (Gong et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2020) as inspiration.

**Novel Aspects:**

The core novelty of the methodology is the **patch-level training** approach itself. The authors don't explicitly cite any prior work that uses this exact approach for LLMs. They justify this novel approach by arguing that it addresses the sparse distribution of information within training data and allows for more efficient utilization of model parameters.


## 5. Results in Context

**Main Results:**

* Patch-level training reduces training costs by 50% (λ = 2/3, K = 4) while maintaining comparable or even slightly improving model performance across a range of model sizes (370M-2.7B parameters) on the Pile dataset.
* The performance benefits of patch-level training are more pronounced with larger datasets.
* The optimal patch size (K) and data fraction (λ) need to be carefully tuned for optimal performance.
* Patch-level training can potentially act as a form of regularization.
* Modifying the model architecture specifically for patch-level training does not necessarily lead to improved performance.

**Comparison with Existing Literature:**

* The authors compare their results with **baseline models** trained using conventional token-level training, demonstrating the cost reduction and performance benefits of patch-level training.
* They also compare their results with models trained from scratch, highlighting the advantage of patch-level initialization.
* The authors discuss the relationship between their work and **model growth** techniques, but they emphasize that patch-level training is more flexible and generalizable.
* They also discuss the relationship between their work and **multi-token prediction** techniques, but they emphasize that their approach differs in its focus on training efficiency rather than inference speed.

**Confirmation, Contradiction, or Extension:**

* The results **confirm** the hypothesis that training costs can be reduced by processing information in larger units (patches).
* The results **extend** the concept of model growth by demonstrating that knowledge can be transferred effectively from a patch-level model to a token-level model.
* The results **partially contradict** the notion that complex architectural modifications are always necessary for improving training efficiency, as the authors find that the standard Transformer architecture is sufficient for patch-level training.
