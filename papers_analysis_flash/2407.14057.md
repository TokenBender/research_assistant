## 2. Section-by-Section Analysis with Citation Extraction

### 2.1 Introduction

- **Key Points:** Introduces the two stages of LLM inference (prefilling and decoding), highlights the bottleneck of long prompts in the prefilling stage (TTFT), and poses the question of whether all prompt tokens are essential for generating the first token.
- **Significant Citations:**

    a. **Claim:** "Standard prompt-based LLM inference has two sequential stages: prefilling and decoding, as shown in Figure 1. During the prefilling stage, the model computes and saves the KV cache of each token from the prompt, and predicts the first token. We refer to the time taken during prefilling stage as "time-to-first-token" (TTFT)."
    b. **Citation:** Touvron et al., 2023; Bai et al., 2023.
    c. **Relevance:** This citation establishes the standard LLM inference process and introduces the concept of TTFT, which is the primary focus of optimization in the paper.

    a. **Claim:** "For long prompts, TTFT could be slow because state-of-the-art transformer-based LLMs are both deep and wide (Pope et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023; Aminabadi et al., 2022), and the cost of computing attention increases quadratically with the number of tokens in the prompts."
    b. **Citation:** Pope et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023; Aminabadi et al., 2022.
    c. **Relevance:** This citation highlights the computational complexity of LLMs, particularly for long prompts, which motivates the need for optimization techniques like LazyLLM.

    a. **Claim:** "While optimizing LLM inference is an active area of research, many methods (Leviathan et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2024; Bhendawade et al., 2024; Li et al., 2024) have focused on improving inference speed during the decoding stage. Yet, there is little attention given to improving TTFT."
    b. **Citation:** Leviathan et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2024; Bhendawade et al., 2024; Li et al., 2024.
    c. **Relevance:** This citation establishes the current state of research in LLM inference optimization, emphasizing that most efforts have been directed towards the decoding stage, while the prefilling stage (and TTFT) has received less attention.
