## 4. Experimental Methodology and Its Foundations

The authors utilize an iterative training approach for their Self-Taught Evaluator. They start with a strong LLM (Llama3-70B-Instruct) as a seed model. The core of their methodology involves:

1. **Instruction Selection:** They curate a subset of instructions from the WildChat dataset, focusing on reasoning-based tasks.
2. **Response Pair Construction:** They generate synthetic preference pairs by prompting the LLM to produce a good and a bad response for each instruction.
3. **Judgment Annotation:** They use the current LLM-as-a-Judge model to generate reasoning traces and judgments for these pairs.
4. **Model Fine-tuning:** They fine-tune the LLM-as-a-Judge model on the labeled synthetic data.
5. **Iteration:** They repeat steps 2-4, using the improved model from the previous iteration to generate new synthetic data.

**Foundations in Cited Works:**

* The authors cite **Zheng et al. (2023)** as a basis for their LLM-as-a-Judge approach, which involves generating reasoning traces and judgments.
* The use of **synthetic data** for training is justified by citing works like **Lam et al. (2023)** and **El Emam et al. (2020)**, which demonstrate its effectiveness in various domains.
* The **iterative training** approach is supported by works like **Yuan et al. (2024)** and **Xu et al. (2023)**, which show the benefits of iterative preference optimization.

**Novel Aspects of Methodology:**

The primary novel aspect is the **self-taught nature of the evaluator**. The authors don't rely on any human-labeled preference data for training. They justify this novel approach by highlighting the limitations of human annotation and the potential of synthetic data to overcome these limitations.


## 5. Results in Context

The paper presents several key results:

* **RewardBench:** The Self-Taught Evaluator achieves a score of 88.3 (88.7 with majority voting), outperforming the seed model and matching the performance of top-performing reward models trained with human annotations. This result is compared to the performance of GPT-4 and other models from the RewardBench leaderboard.
* **MT-Bench:** The model achieves comparable performance to GPT-4 in terms of agreement with human judgments.
* **HelpSteer2:** The model improves position-consistent accuracy compared to the seed model.

**Comparison with Existing Literature:**
