**Contribution to the Field:**

The paper makes a significant contribution to the field of LLM inference by introducing Double Sparsity, a novel post-training sparse attention technique that combines token and channel sparsity to accelerate attention computation. Double Sparsity-Offload further enhances efficiency by reducing memory usage through offloading. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of these techniques through extensive empirical evaluation across various benchmarks, showing significant speedups and minimal accuracy loss.
