### 2.3 Exploration on Heterogeneous Mixture of Experts

**Summary:** This section describes the authors' initial exploration of HMoE, where they introduce heterogeneity by assigning different sizes to experts. However, they find that this intuitive approach doesn't significantly outperform conventional MoE due to an imbalance in expert activation, with larger experts being overly activated. This leads to a reduction in the model's representational capacity.

**Significant Citations:** 

* **Claim:** "Upon investigation, we discovered that the primary reason for this underperformance was the highly imbalanced load distribution among experts in the HMoE. Larger experts were activated more frequently, while smaller ones were rarely utilized."
