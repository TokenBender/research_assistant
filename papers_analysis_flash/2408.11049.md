    a. **Claim:** "We can find that speculative decoding consistently outperforms autoregressive decoding except when the batch size is large and the sequence length is short."
    b. **Citation:** None directly cited for this specific claim, but the results are compared implicitly to the baseline of autoregressive decoding throughout the paper.
    c. **Relevance:** This claim is supported by the experimental results presented in Figures 5 and 6, which show the speedup achieved by speculative decoding across various batch sizes and sequence lengths.

    a. **Claim:** "Moreover, as the sequence length increases, the speedup grows with batch size, achieving both higher throughput and lower latency."

This is because the H100 has a higher FLOPS-to-memory bandwidth ratio than the A100, leading to Ty≈ Tr. Additionally, the higher compute bandwidth of the H100 reduces TD, resulting in better speedup."
