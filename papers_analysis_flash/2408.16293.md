- **Key Points:**
    - The authors discuss the "regretful" behavior of language models, where they often "realize" their mistakes during generation.

    - **Citation:** None
    - **Explanation:** This statement summarizes the key finding of this section, highlighting the limitations of LoRA finetuning for error correction.
